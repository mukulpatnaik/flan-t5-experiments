This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the
Texas gourd study.

This passage is adapted from Brian Greene, “How the Higgs
Boson Was Found.” ©2013 by Smithsonian Institution. The
Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the
Higgs field. Experiments conducted in 2012–2013
tentatively confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and
thus of the Higgs field.

    Nearly a half-century ago, Peter Higgs and a
handful of other physicists were trying to understand
the origin of a basic physical feature: mass. You can
think of mass as an object’s heft or, a little more
precisely, as the resistance it offers to having its
motion changed. Push on a freight train (or a
feather) to increase its speed, and the resistance you
feel reflects its mass. At a microscopic level, the
freight train’s mass comes from its constituent
molecules and atoms, which are themselves built
from fundamental particles, electrons and quarks.
But where do the masses of these and other
fundamental particles come from?
    When physicists in the 1960s modeled the
behavior of these particles using equations rooted in
quantum physics, they encountered a puzzle. If they
imagined that the particles were all massless, then
each term in the equations clicked into a perfectly
symmetric pattern, like the tips of a perfect
snowflake. And this symmetry was not just
mathematically elegant. It explained patterns evident
in the experimental data. But—and here’s the
puzzle—physicists knew that the particles did have
mass, and when they modified the equations to
account for this fact, the mathematical harmony was
spoiled. The equations became complex and
unwieldy and, worse still, inconsistent.
    What to do? Here’s the idea put forward by Higgs.
Don’t shove the particles’ masses down the throat of
the beautiful equations. Instead, keep the equations
pristine and symmetric, but consider them operating
within a peculiar environment. Imagine that all of
space is uniformly filled with an invisible
substance—now called the Higgs field—that exerts a
drag force on particles when they accelerate through
it. Push on a fundamental particle in an effort to
increase its speed and, according to Higgs, you would
feel this drag force as a resistance. Justifiably, you
would interpret the resistance as the particle’s mass.
For a mental toehold, think of a ping-pong ball
submerged in water. When you push on the
ping-pong ball, it will feel much more massive than it
does outside of water. Its interaction with the watery
environment has the effect of endowing it with mass.
So with particles submerged in the Higgs field.
    In 1964, Higgs submitted a paper to a prominent
physics journal in which he formulated this idea
mathematically. The paper was rejected. Not because
it contained a technical error, but because the
premise of an invisible something permeating space,
interacting with particles to provide their mass, well,
it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought
speculation. The editors of the journal deemed it “of
no obvious relevance to physics.”
    But Higgs persevered (and his revised paper
appeared later that year in another journal), and
physicists who took the time to study the proposal
gradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius,
one that allowed them to have their cake and eat it
too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations
can retain their pristine form because the dirty work
of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the
environment.
    While I wasn’t around to witness the initial
rejection of Higgs’s proposal in 1964 (well, I was
around, but only barely), I can attest that by the
mid-1980s, the assessment had changed. The physics
community had, for the most part, fully bought into
the idea that there was a Higgs field permeating
space. In fact, in a graduate course I took that
covered what’s known as the Standard Model of
Particle Physics (the quantum equations physicists
have assembled to describe the particles of matter
and the dominant forces by which they influence
each other), the professor presented the Higgs field
with such certainty that for a long while I had no idea
it had yet to be established experimentally.
On occasion, that happens in physics. Mathematical
equations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale,
they can seemingly radiate reality so strongly, that
they become entrenched in the vernacular of
working physicists, even before there’s data to
confirm them.



Question 42:
Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from
A) a technical account of the Higgs field to a description of it aimed at a broad audience.
B) a review of Higgs’s work to a contextualization of that work within Higgs’s era.
C) an explanation of the Higgs field to a discussion of the response to Higgs’s theory.

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”




Question 24:
What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
A) The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
B) Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
C) The ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
D) The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.



Question 49:
According to the passage, when compared to mental athletes, the individuals in the control group in Maguire’s second study
A) showed less brain activity overall.
B) demonstrated a wider range of cognitive ability.
C) exhibited different patterns of brain activity.

This passage is from Charlotte Brontë, The Professor,
originally published in 1857.

    No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a
mistake in the choice of his profession, and every
man, worthy of the name, will row long against wind
and tide before he allows himself to cry out, “I am
baffled!” and submits to be floated passively back to
land. From the first week of my residence in X—
felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself—the
work of copying and translating business-letters—
was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been
all, I should long have borne with the nuisance; I am
not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the
double desire of getting my living and justifying to
myself and others the resolution I had taken to
become a tradesman, I should have endured in
silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I
should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I
longed for liberty; I should have pent in every sigh by
which my heart might have ventured to intimate its
distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and
joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the
tender and the mighty, should never, either by
softness or strength, have severed me. But this was
not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between
myself and my employer striking deeper root and
spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from
every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to
feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the
slimy walls of a well.
    Antipathy is the only word which can express the
feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in
a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to
be excited by every, the most trifling movement,
look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed
him; the degree of education evinced in my language
irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and
accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high
flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I
too should one day make a successful tradesman.
Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not
have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he
knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he
was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a
ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have
forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three
faculties—Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling
and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never
baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels.
Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it
would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its
slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.
    I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was
returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul
with the pleasant feeling that the master who had
paid me grudged every penny of that hard‑earned
pittance—(I had long ceased to regard
Mr. Crimsworth as my brother—he was a hard,
grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable
tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong,
occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me;
again and again they uttered the same monotonous
phrases. One said: “William, your life is intolerable.”
The other: “What can you do to alter it?” I walked
fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I
approached my lodgings, I turned from a general
view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to
whether my fire would be out; looking towards the
window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red
gleam.

This passage is adapted from Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle
S. Adams, ""Money Can't Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs about
Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation."" ©2008 by Elsevier
Inc.

    Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
full force—both online and on foot—searching
frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
that their purchases will disappoint rather than
delight the intended recipients.
    Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
social process, serving various political, religious, and
psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
not very good at predicting what gifts others will
appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
psychologists. Research has found that people often
struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
projection, and multiple attribution errors.
    What is surprising is that gift-givers have
considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and
gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend
each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.
In the present research, we propose a unique
psychological explanation for this overspending
problem—i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they
spend with how much recipients will appreciate the
gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a
gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation). Although a
link between gift price and feelings of appreciation
might seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an
assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose
that gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their
feelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift
than givers assume.
    Why do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely
linked to gift-recipients’ feelings of appreciation?
Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more
expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of
thoughtfulness and consideration. According to
Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a
symbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal
their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future
relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be
motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to
send a “stronger signal” to their intended recipient.
As for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller
and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger
signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.
    The notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being
unable to account for the other party’s perspective
seems puzzling because people slip in and out of
these roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple
times in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the
extensive experience that people have as both givers
and receivers, they often struggle to transfer
information gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)
and apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as
a receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize
information about their own preferences and
experiences in order to produce more efficient
outcomes in their exchange relations. In practical
terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on
gifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift
expenditures according to personal insight.

This passage is adapted from Bryan Walsh, “Whole Food
Blues: Why Organic Agriculture May Not Be So Sustainable.”
©2012 by Time Inc.

    When it comes to energy, everyone loves
efficiency. Cutting energy waste is one of those goals
that both sides of the political divide can agree on,
even if they sometimes diverge on how best to get
there. Energy efficiency allows us to get more out of
our given resources, which is good for the economy
and (mostly) good for the environment as well. In
an increasingly hot and crowded world, the only
sustainable way to live is to get more out of less.
Every environmentalist would agree.
    But change the conversation to food, and
suddenly efficiency doesn’t look so good.
Conventional industrial agriculture has become
incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis.
Thanks to fertilizers, mechanization and irrigation,
each American farmer feeds over 155 people
worldwide. Conventional farming gets more and
more crop per square foot of cultivated land—
over 170 bushels of corn per acre in Iowa, for
example—which can mean less territory needs to
be converted from wilderness to farmland.
And since a third of the planet is already used for
agriculture—destroying forests and other wild
habitats along the way—anything that could help us
produce more food on less land would seem to be
good for the environment.
    Of course, that’s not how most environmentalists
regard their arugula [a leafy green]. They have
embraced organic food as better for the planet—and
healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by
agricultural corporations. Environmentalists disdain
the enormous amounts of energy needed and waste
created by conventional farming, while organic
practices—forgoing artificial fertilizers and chemical
pesticides—are considered far more sustainable.
Sales of organic food rose 7.7% in 2010, up to $26.7
billion—and people are making those purchases for
their consciences as much as their taste buds.
    Yet a new meta-analysis in Nature does the math
and comes to a hard conclusion: organic farming
yields 25% fewer crops on average than conventional
agriculture. More land is therefore needed to
produce fewer crops—and that means organic
farming may not be as good for the planet as
we think.
    In the Nature analysis, scientists from McGill
University in Montreal and the University of
Minnesota performed an analysis of 66 studies
comparing conventional and organic methods across
34 different crop species, from fruits to grains to
legumes. They found that organic farming delivered
a lower yield for every crop type, though the disparity
varied widely. For rain-watered legume crops like
beans or perennial crops like fruit trees, organic
trailed conventional agriculture by just 5%. Yet for
major cereal crops like corn or wheat, as well as most
vegetables—all of which provide the bulk of the
world’s calories—conventional agriculture
outperformed organics by more than 25%.
    The main difference is nitrogen, the chemical key
to plant growth. Conventional agriculture makes use
of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each
year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant
growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the
compost or cover crops used in organic farming.
When we talk about a Green Revolution, we really
mean a nitrogen revolution—along with a lot
of water.
    But not all the nitrogen used in conventional
fertilizer ends up in crops—much of it ends up
running off the soil and into the oceans, creating vast
polluted dead zones. We’re already putting more
nitrogen into the soil than the planet can stand over
the long term. And conventional agriculture also
depends heavily on chemical pesticides, which can
have unintended side effects.
    What that means is that while conventional
agriculture is more efficient—sometimes much more
efficient—than organic farming, there are trade-offs
with each. So an ideal global agriculture system, in
the views of the study’s authors, may borrow the best
from both systems, as Jonathan Foley of the
University of Minnesota explained:
   The bottom line? Today’s organic farming
   practices are probably best deployed in fruit and
   vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not
   just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for
   delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple
   crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on,
   conventional farms have the advantage right
   now.
   Looking forward, I think we will need to deploy
   different kinds of practices (especially new,
   mixed approaches that take the best of organic
   and conventional farming systems) where they
   are best suited—geographically, economically,
   socially, etc.

This passage is adapted from J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick,
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid.” ©1953 by Nature Publishing Group. Watson and Crick
deduced the structure of DNA using evidence from Rosalind
Franklin and R. G. Gosling’s X-ray crystallography diagrams
of DNA and from Erwin Chargaff’s data on the base
composition of DNA.

    The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a
very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a
regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.
To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which
can be of four different types. Two of the possible
bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the
other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.
So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the
chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of
phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.
    The first feature of our structure which is of
biological interest is that it consists not of one chain,
but of two. These two chains are both coiled around
a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that
since there was only one chain in the chemical
formula there would only be one in the structural
unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray
evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.
    The other biologically important feature is the
manner in which the two chains are held together.
This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases.
The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base
from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single
base from the other. The important point is that only
certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.
One member of a pair must be a purine and the other
a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two
chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for
example, there would not be room for it.
    We believe that the bases will be present almost
entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true,
the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are:
adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine.
Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but
when it does, its partner on the other chain must
always be thymine.
    The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is
completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of
bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a
long molecule many different permutations are
possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise
sequence of bases is the code which carries the
genetical information. If the actual order of the bases
on one of the pair of chains were given, one could
write down the exact order of the bases on the other
one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain
is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule might duplicate itself.

This passage is adapted from Alan Ehrenhalt, The Great
Inversion and the Future of the American City. ©2013 by
Vintage. Ehrenhalt is an urbanologist—a scholar of cities
and their development. Demographic inversion is a
phenomenon that describes the rearrangement of living
patterns throughout a metropolitan area.

    We are not witnessing the abandonment of the
suburbs, or a movement of millions of people back to
the city all at once. The 2010 census certainly did not
turn up evidence of a middle-class stampede to the
nation’s cities. The news was mixed: Some of the
larger cities on the East Coast tended to gain
population, albeit in small increments. Those in the
Midwest, including Chicago, tended to lose
substantial numbers. The cities that showed gains in
overall population during the entire decade tended to
be in the South and Southwest. But when it comes to
measuring demographic inversion, raw census
numbers are an ineffective blunt instrument. A closer
look at the results shows that the most powerful
demographic events of the past decade were the
movement of African Americans out of central cities
(180,000 of them in Chicago alone) and the
settlement of immigrant groups in suburbs, often
ones many miles distant from downtown.
Central-city areas that gained affluent residents in
the first part of the decade maintained that
population in the recession years from 2007 to 2009.
They also, according to a 2011 study by Brookings,
suffered considerably less from increased
unemployment than the suburbs did. Not many
young professionals moved to new downtown
condos in the recession years because few such
residences were being built. But there is no reason to
believe that the demographic trends prevailing prior
to the construction bust will not resume once that
bust is over. It is important to remember that
demographic inversion is not a proxy for population
growth; it can occur in cities that are growing, those
whose numbers are flat, and even in those
undergoing a modest decline in size.
    America’s major cities face enormous fiscal
problems, many of them the result of public pension
obligations they incurred in the more prosperous
years of the past two decades. Some, Chicago
prominent among them, simply are not producing
enough revenue to support the level of public
services to which most of the citizens have grown to
feel entitled. How the cities are going to solve this
problem, I do not know. What I do know is that if
fiscal crisis were going to drive affluent professionals
out of central cities, it would have done so by now.
There is no evidence that it has.
    The truth is that we are living at a moment in
which the massive outward migration of the affluent
that characterized the second half of the
twentieth century is coming to an end. And we need
to adjust our perceptions of cities, suburbs, and
urban mobility as a result.
    Much of our perspective on the process of
metropolitan settlement dates, whether we realize it
or not, from a paper written in 1925 by the
University of Chicago sociologist Ernest W. Burgess.
It was Burgess who defined four urban/suburban
zones of settlement: a central business district; an
area of manufacturing just beyond it; then a
residential area inhabited by the industrial and
immigrant working class; and finally an outer
enclave of single-family dwellings.
    Burgess was right about the urban America of
1925; he was right about the urban America of 1974.
Virtually every city in the country had a downtown,
where the commercial life of the metropolis was
conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had
districts of working-class residences just beyond that;
and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the
upper middle class at the far end of the continuum.
As a family moved up the economic ladder, it also
moved outward from crowded working-class
districts to more spacious apartments and,
eventually, to a suburban home. The suburbs of
Burgess’s time bore little resemblance to those at the
end of the twentieth century, but the theory still
essentially worked. People moved ahead in life by
moving farther out.
    But in the past decade, in quite a few places, this
model has ceased to describe reality. There are still
downtown commercial districts, but there are no
factory districts lying next to them. There are
scarcely any factories at all. These close-in parts of
the city, whose few residents Burgess described as
dwelling in “submerged regions of poverty,
degradation and disease,” are increasingly the
preserve of the affluent who work in the commercial
core. And just as crucially newcomers to America are
not settling on the inside and accumulating the
resources to move out; they are living in the suburbs
from day one.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

The narrator indicates that he pays Sempere
A) less than Sempere expects him to pay for the books.

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.



Question 17:
In Passage 2, Grimké makes which point about human rights?
A) They are viewed differently in various cultures around the world.
B) They retain their moral authority regardless of whether they are recognized by law.
C) They are sometimes at odds with moral responsibilities.

This passage is adapted from Rachel Ehrenberg, “Salt
Stretches in Nanoworld.” ©2009 by Society for Science & the
Public. The “nanoworld” is the world observed on a scale
one billionth that of ordinary human experience.

    Inflexible old salt becomes a softy in the
nanoworld, stretching like taffy to more than twice
its length, researchers report. The findings may lead
to new approaches for making nanowires that could
end up in solar cells or electronic circuits. The work
also suggests that these ultra-tiny salt wires may
already exist in sea spray and large underground salt
deposits.
    “We think nanowires are special and go to great
lengths to make them,” says study coauthor
Nathan Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque. “Maybe they are more common than
we think.”
    Metals such as gold or lead, in which bonding
angles are loosey-goosey, can stretch out at
temperatures well below their melting points.
But scientists don’t expect this superplasticity in a
rigid, crystalline material like salt, Moore says.
    This unusual behavior highlights that different
forces rule the nanoworld, says theoretical physicist
Krzysztof Kempa of Boston College. “Forget about
gravity. It plays no role,” he says. Surface tension and
electrostatic forces are much more important at this
scale.
    Moore and his colleagues discovered salt’s
stretchiness accidently. They were investigating how
water sticks to a surface such as salt and created a
super-dry salt sample for testing. After cleaving a
chunk of salt about the size of a sugar cube with a
razor, the scientists guided a microscope that detects
forces toward the surface. When the tip was far away
there was no measured force, but within about seven
nanometers a very strong attraction rapidly
developed between the diamond tip of the
microscope and the salt. The salt actually stretched
out to glom on to the microscope tip. Using an
electron microscope to see what was happening, the
researchers observed the nanowires.
    The initial attraction between the tip and salt
might be due to electrostatic forces, perhaps good old
van der Waals interactions, the researchers
speculate. Several mechanisms might lead to the
elasticity, including the excessive surface tension
found in the nanoworld (the same tension that allows
a water strider to skim the surface of a pond).
    The surface tension is so strong that as the
microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt
stretches, Kempa says. “The inside has no choice but
to rearrange the atoms, rather than break,” he says.
    This bizarre behavior is actually mirrored in the
macroworld, the researchers say. Huge underground
deposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is
believed to play a role at these scales. Perhaps salty
nanowires are present in these deposits as well.
    “Sodium chloride is everywhere—in the air, in
our bodies,” Moore says. “This may change our view
of things, of what’s happening at the nanoscale.”
    The work also suggests new techniques for
making nanowires, which are often created through
nano-imprinting techniques, Kempa says. “We
invoke the intuition of the macroworld,” he says.
“Maybe instead of stamping [nanowires] we should

This passage is adapted from John Bohannon, “Why You
Shouldn’t Trust Internet Comments.” ©2013 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

    The “wisdom of crowds” has become a mantra of
the Internet age. Need to choose a new vacuum
cleaner? Check out the reviews on online merchant
Amazon. But a new study suggests that such online
scores don’t always reveal the best choice. A massive
controlled experiment of Web users finds that such
ratings are highly susceptible to irrational “herd
behavior”—and that the herd can be manipulated.
Sometimes the crowd really is wiser than you. The
classic examples are guessing the weight of a bull or
the number of gumballs in a jar. Your guess is
probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the
average of many people’s choices is remarkably close
to the true number.
    But what happens when the goal is to judge
something less tangible, such as the quality or worth
of a product? According to one theory, the wisdom
of the crowd still holds—measuring the aggregate of
people’s opinions produces a stable, reliable
value. Skeptics, however, argue that people’s
opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So
nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary
opinions—for example, exposing them to some very
good or very bad attitudes—will steer the crowd in a
different direction. To test which hypothesis is true,
you would need to manipulate huge numbers of
people, exposing them to false information and
determining how it affects their opinions.
    A team led by Sinan Aral, a network scientist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, did exactly that. Aral has been secretly
working with a popular website that aggregates news
stories. The website allows users to make comments
about news stories and vote each other’s comments
up or down. The vote tallies are visible as a number
next to each comment, and the position of the
comments is chronological. (Stories on the site get an
average of about ten comments and about three votes
per comment.) It’s a follow-up to his experiment
using people’s ratings of movies to measure how
much individual people influence each other online
(answer: a lot). This time, he wanted to know how
much the crowd influences the individual, and
whether it can be controlled from outside.
    For five months, every comment submitted by a
user randomly received an “up” vote (positive); a
“down” vote (negative); or as a control, no vote at all.
The team then observed how users rated those
comments. The users generated more than
100,000 comments that were viewed more than
10 million times and rated more than 300,000 times
by other users.
    At least when it comes to comments on news
sites, the crowd is more herdlike than wise.
Comments that received fake positive votes from the
researchers were 32% more likely to receive more
positive votes compared with a control, the team
reports. And those comments were no more likely
than the control to be down-voted by the next viewer
to see them. By the end of the study, positively
manipulated comments got an overall boost of about
25%. However, the same did not hold true for
negative manipulation. The ratings of comments that
got a fake down vote were usually negated by an up
vote by the next user to see them.
    “Our experiment does not reveal the psychology
behind people’s decisions,” Aral says, “but an
intuitive explanation is that people are more
skeptical of negative social influence. They’re more
willing to go along with positive opinions from other
people.”
    Duncan Watts, a network scientist at Microsoft
Research in New York City, agrees with that
conclusion. “[But] one question is whether the
positive [herding] bias is specific to this site” or true
in general, Watts says. He points out that the
category of the news items in the experiment had a
strong effect on how much people could be
manipulated. “I would have thought that ‘business’ is
pretty similar to ‘economics,’ yet they find a much
stronger effect (almost 50% stronger) for the former
than the latter. What explains this difference? If we’re
going to apply these findings in the real world, we’ll
need to know the answers.”
    Will companies be able to boost their products by
manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?
“That is easier said than done,” Watts says. If people
detect—or learn—that comments on a website are
being manipulated, the herd may spook and leave
entirely.

Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from a discussion of an experiment and its results to
A) an explanation of the practical applications of the results.
B) a consideration of the questions prompted by the results.
C) an analysis of the defects undermining the results.

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.



Question 50:
The passage most strongly suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they
A) exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
B) convert information they are trying to memorize into abstract symbols.
C) organize information into numerical lists prior to memorization.
D) exercise their brains regularly through puzzles and other mental challenges.

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.



Question 3:
Which statement best describes a technique the narrator uses to represent Silas’s character before he adopted Eppie?
A) The narrator emphasizes Silas’s former obsession with wealth by depicting his gold as requiring certain behaviors on his part.
B) The narrator underscores Silas’s former greed by describing his gold as seeming to reproduce on its own.
C) The narrator hints at Silas’s former antisocial attitude by contrasting his present behavior toward his neighbors with his past behavior toward them.
D) The narrator demonstrates Silas’s former lack of self-awareness by implying that he is unable to recall life before Eppie.

This passage is adapted from Alan Ehrenhalt, The Great
Inversion and the Future of the American City. ©2013 by
Vintage. Ehrenhalt is an urbanologist—a scholar of cities
and their development. Demographic inversion is a
phenomenon that describes the rearrangement of living
patterns throughout a metropolitan area.

    We are not witnessing the abandonment of the
suburbs, or a movement of millions of people back to
the city all at once. The 2010 census certainly did not
turn up evidence of a middle-class stampede to the
nation’s cities. The news was mixed: Some of the
larger cities on the East Coast tended to gain
population, albeit in small increments. Those in the
Midwest, including Chicago, tended to lose
substantial numbers. The cities that showed gains in
overall population during the entire decade tended to
be in the South and Southwest. But when it comes to
measuring demographic inversion, raw census
numbers are an ineffective blunt instrument. A closer
look at the results shows that the most powerful
demographic events of the past decade were the
movement of African Americans out of central cities
(180,000 of them in Chicago alone) and the
settlement of immigrant groups in suburbs, often
ones many miles distant from downtown.
Central-city areas that gained affluent residents in
the first part of the decade maintained that
population in the recession years from 2007 to 2009.
They also, according to a 2011 study by Brookings,
suffered considerably less from increased
unemployment than the suburbs did. Not many
young professionals moved to new downtown
condos in the recession years because few such
residences were being built. But there is no reason to
believe that the demographic trends prevailing prior
to the construction bust will not resume once that
bust is over. It is important to remember that
demographic inversion is not a proxy for population
growth; it can occur in cities that are growing, those
whose numbers are flat, and even in those
undergoing a modest decline in size.
    America’s major cities face enormous fiscal
problems, many of them the result of public pension
obligations they incurred in the more prosperous
years of the past two decades. Some, Chicago
prominent among them, simply are not producing
enough revenue to support the level of public
services to which most of the citizens have grown to
feel entitled. How the cities are going to solve this
problem, I do not know. What I do know is that if
fiscal crisis were going to drive affluent professionals
out of central cities, it would have done so by now.
There is no evidence that it has.
    The truth is that we are living at a moment in
which the massive outward migration of the affluent
that characterized the second half of the
twentieth century is coming to an end. And we need
to adjust our perceptions of cities, suburbs, and
urban mobility as a result.
    Much of our perspective on the process of
metropolitan settlement dates, whether we realize it
or not, from a paper written in 1925 by the
University of Chicago sociologist Ernest W. Burgess.
It was Burgess who defined four urban/suburban
zones of settlement: a central business district; an
area of manufacturing just beyond it; then a
residential area inhabited by the industrial and
immigrant working class; and finally an outer
enclave of single-family dwellings.
    Burgess was right about the urban America of
1925; he was right about the urban America of 1974.
Virtually every city in the country had a downtown,
where the commercial life of the metropolis was
conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had
districts of working-class residences just beyond that;
and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the
upper middle class at the far end of the continuum.
As a family moved up the economic ladder, it also
moved outward from crowded working-class
districts to more spacious apartments and,
eventually, to a suburban home. The suburbs of
Burgess’s time bore little resemblance to those at the
end of the twentieth century, but the theory still
essentially worked. People moved ahead in life by
moving farther out.
    But in the past decade, in quite a few places, this
model has ceased to describe reality. There are still
downtown commercial districts, but there are no
factory districts lying next to them. There are
scarcely any factories at all. These close-in parts of
the city, whose few residents Burgess described as
dwelling in “submerged regions of poverty,
degradation and disease,” are increasingly the
preserve of the affluent who work in the commercial
core. And just as crucially newcomers to America are
not settling on the inside and accumulating the
resources to move out; they are living in the suburbs
from day one.



Question 16:
The passage implies that American cities in 1974
A) were witnessing the flight of minority populations to the suburbs.
B) had begun to lose their manufacturing sectors.
C) had a traditional four-zone structure.
D) were already experiencing demographic inversion.

This passage is adapted from Amy Tan, The Bonesetter’s
Daughter. ©2001 by Amy Tan.

    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

The central problem that Stanton describes in the passage is that women have been
A) denied equal educational opportunities, which has kept them from reaching their potential.

This passage is adapted from David Rotman, “How
Technology Is Destroying Jobs.” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    MIT business scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee have argued that impressive
advances in computer technology—from improved
industrial robotics to automated translation
services—are largely behind the sluggish
employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
more ominous for workers, they foresee dismal
prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful
new technologies are increasingly adopted not only
in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in
professions such as law, financial services, education,
and medicine.
    That robots, automation, and software can replace
people might seem obvious to anyone who’s worked
in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But
Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s claim is more troubling
and controversial. They believe that rapid
technological change has been destroying jobs faster
than it is creating them, contributing to the
stagnation of median income and the growth of
inequality in the United States. And, they suspect,
something similar is happening in other
technologically advanced countries.
    As evidence, Brynjolfsson and McAfee point to a
chart that only an economist could love. In
economics, productivity—the amount of economic
value created for a given unit of input, such as an
hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and
wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the
chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines
represent productivity and total employment in the
United States. For years after World War II, the
two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in
jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The
pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value
from their workers, the country as a whole became
richer, which fueled more economic activity and
created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the
lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,
but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a
significant gap appears between the two lines,
showing economic growth with no parallel increase
in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the
“great decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is
confident that technology is behind both the healthy
growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.
    It’s a startling assertion because it threatens the
faith that many economists place in technological
progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that
technology boosts productivity and makes societies
wealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark
side: technological progress is eliminating the need
for many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker
worse off than before. Brynjolfsson can point to a
second chart indicating that median income is failing
to rise even as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s
the great paradox of our era,” he says. “Productivity
is at record levels, innovation has never been faster,
and yet at the same time, we have a falling median
income and we have fewer jobs. People are falling
behind because technology is advancing so fast and
our skills and organizations aren’t keeping up.”
    While technological changes can be painful for
workers whose skills no longer match the needs of
employers, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist,
says that no historical pattern shows these shifts
leading to a net decrease in jobs over an extended
period. Katz has done extensive research on how
technological advances have affected jobs over the
last few centuries—describing, for example, how
highly skilled artisans in the mid-19th century were
displaced by lower-skilled workers in factories.
While it can take decades for workers to acquire the
expertise needed for new types of employment, he
says, “we never have run out of jobs. There is no
long-term trend of eliminating work for people. Over
the long term, employment rates are fairly
stable. People have always been able to create new
jobs. People come up with new things to do.”
    Still, Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is
something different about today’s digital
technologies—something that could affect an even
broader range of work. The question, he says, is
whether economic history will serve as a useful
guide. Will the job disruptions caused by technology
be temporary as the workforce adapts, or will we see

This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is
Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,
but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the
doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The
poor market may be slowing innovation, but
advances continue; judging by the mood this week at
the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in
Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
    The technology that’s surprised almost everyone
is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,
silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and
Martin Green, professor at the University of
New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar
panel researchers, declared that they’d never go
below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like
50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per
watt,” he says.
    The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of
reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar
panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020.
Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target
even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the
direct cost of solar power to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost
expected for power from new natural gas power
plants.
    All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have
been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the
power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady
cost reductions. Green points to something as
mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of
the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar
cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon
solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To
achieve that record, he had to use expensive
lithography techniques to make fine wires for
collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual
improvements have made it possible to use screen
printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research
suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce
lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of
the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at
costs far lower than his lithography techniques.
    Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a
new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,
which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar
cell they made is the only current challenger to
silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film
cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower
the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power
cheaper.
    One of Green’s former students and colleagues,
Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer
China Sunergy, announced this week that he is
building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided
solar cell that can absorb light from both the front
and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that
during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the
land between rows of solar panels in a solar power
plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels
and could be harvested to increase the power output.
This works particularly well when the solar panels
are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a
one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a
two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He
expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more
electricity over the course of a year.
    Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,
aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in
cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to
greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels
by combining silicon with one or two other
semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a
part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert
efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost
efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to
around 40 percent. Adding another could make
efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which
would cut in half the number of solar panels needed
for a given installation. The challenge is to produce
good connections between these semiconductors,
something made challenging by the arrangement of
silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.



Question 45:
It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage that many people in the solar panel industry believe that
A) consumers don’t understand how solar panels work.
B) two-sided cells have weaknesses that have not yet been discovered.
C) the cost of solar panels is too high and their power output too low.
D) Willow Glass is too inefficient to be marketable.

This passage is adapted from Daniel Chamovitz, What a
Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses. ©2012 by
Daniel Chamovitz

    The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
    We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled
with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left
to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify
the protein. Et voilà—human medicine! And, for
GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006,
becoming the world’s first transgenic animal drug.
Over the course of a year, the “milking parlors” on
GTC’s 300-acre farm in Massachusetts can collect
more than a kilogram of medicine from a single
animal.

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.

This passage is adapted from Virginia Woolf, Three Guineas.
©1938 by Harcourt, Inc. Here, Woolf considers the situation
of women in English society.

    Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames,
an admirable vantage ground for us to make a
survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden
with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other,
Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a
place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not
now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession—the procession of the sons of educated
men.
    There they go, our brothers who have been
educated at public schools and universities,
mounting those steps, passing in and out of those
doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine,
transacting business, making money. It is a solemn
sight always—a procession, like a caravanserai
crossing a desert. . . . But now, for the past twenty
years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a
photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of
time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic
appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that
makes a difference. We who have looked so long at
the pageant in books, or from a curtained window
watched educated men leaving the house at about
nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house
at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively
no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount
those steps, pass in and out of those doors,... make
money, administer justice. . . . We who now agitate
these humble pens may in another century or two
speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine
spirit—a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say
whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in
military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old
family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that
venerable object was never decorated with plumes of
white horsehair. You laugh—indeed the shadow of
the private house still makes those dresses look a
little queer. We have worn private clothes so
long. . . . But we have not come here to laugh, or to
talk of fashions—men’s and women’s. We are here,
on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions.
And they are very important questions; and we have
very little time in which to answer them. The
questions that we have to ask and to answer about
that procession during this moment of transition are
so important that they may well change the lives of
all men and women for ever. For we have to ask
ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don’t we? On what terms shall we join
that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the
procession of educated men? The moment is short; it
may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a
matter of a few months longer.... But, you will
object, you have no time to think; you have your
battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to
organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam.
As you know from your own experience, and there
are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men
have always done their thinking from hand to
mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought
while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the
cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our
brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on
thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think
we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while
we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations
and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think . . . in the
gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts;
let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals.
Let us never cease from thinking—what is this
“civilization” in which we find ourselves? What are
these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why
should we make money out of them? Where in
short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of
educated men?

Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is
adapted from a speech delivered in 1900 by William
Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.



Question 41:
It can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being
A) unrealistic, since most Americans would be unwilling to relocate to distant islands.
B) deceptive, since economic domination would be the true goal of the American government.
C) impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.
D) naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the
Texas gourd study.

This passage is adapted from Daniyal Mueenuddin,
“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
    The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
    “What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”
    “Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
    “And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
    The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
    The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.



Question 44:
The author of Passage 1 suggests that an advantage of the method Lewis’s team used to grow microorganisms is that it
A) identifies the requirements for soil bacteria to thrive and replicates those features in artificial soil.
B) enables soil bacteria to take in more nutrients than they typically consume in natural settings.
C) directly affects the cell walls of bacteria rather than the proteins those bacteria produce.
D) allows researchers to make use of soil bacteria that they had previously been unable to exploit.

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.
Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the
only way in which capacities can be proved,—by
trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best
faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere
beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that
whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of
mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those
faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only
in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the
qualities which are not permitted to be exercised
shall not exist.



Question 40:
Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual’s proper position in society?
A) Tocqueville believes that an individual’s position should be defined in important ways by that individual’s sex, while Mill believes that an individual’s abilities should be the determining factor.
B) Tocqueville believes that an individual’s economic class should determine that individual’s position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.
C) Tocqueville believes that an individual’s temperament should determine that individual’s position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual’s position.
D) Tocqueville believes that an individual’s position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding.

This passage is adapted from Geoffrey Giller, “Long a
Mystery, How 500-Meter-High Undersea Waves Form Is
Revealed.” ©2014 by Scientific American.

    Some of the largest ocean waves in the world are
nearly impossible to see. Unlike other large waves,
these rollers, called internal waves, do not ride the
ocean surface. Instead, they move underwater,
undetectable without the use of satellite imagery or
sophisticated monitoring equipment. Despite their
hidden nature, internal waves are fundamental parts
of ocean water dynamics, transferring heat to the
ocean depths and bringing up cold water from below.
And they can reach staggering heights—some as tall
as skyscrapers.
    Because these waves are involved in ocean mixing
and thus the transfer of heat, understanding them is
crucial to global climate modeling, says Tom
Peacock, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Most models fail to take internal
waves into account. “If we want to have more and
more accurate climate models, we have to be able to
capture processes such as this,” Peacock says.
    Peacock and his colleagues tried to do just that.
Their study, published in November in Geophysical
Research Letters, focused on internal waves generated
in the Luzon Strait, which separates Taiwan and the
Philippines. Internal waves in this region, thought to
be some of the largest in the world, can reach about
500 meters high. “That’s the same height as the
Freedom Tower that’s just been built in New York,”
Peacock says.
    Although scientists knew of this phenomenon in
the South China Sea and beyond, they didn’t know
exactly how internal waves formed. To find out,
Peacock and a team of researchers from M.I.T. and
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution worked with
France’s National Center for Scientific Research
using a giant facility there called the Coriolis
Platform. The rotating platform, about 15 meters
(49.2 feet) in diameter, turns at variable speeds and
can simulate Earth’s rotation. It also has walls, which
means scientists can fill it with water and create
accurate, large-scale simulations of various
oceanographic scenarios.
    Peacock and his team built a carbon-fiber resin
scale model of the Luzon Strait, including the islands
and surrounding ocean floor topography. Then they
filled the platform with water of varying salinity to
replicate the different densities found at the strait,
with denser, saltier water below and lighter, less
briny water above. Small particles were added to the
solution and illuminated with lights from below in
order to track how the liquid moved. Finally, they
re-created tides using two large plungers to see how
the internal waves themselves formed.
    The Luzon Strait’s underwater topography, with a
distinct double-ridge shape, turns out to be
responsible for generating the underwater waves.
As the tide rises and falls and water moves through
the strait, colder, denser water is pushed up over the
ridges into warmer, less dense layers above it.
This action results in bumps of colder water trailed
by warmer water that generate an internal wave.
As these waves move toward land, they become
steeper—much the same way waves at the beach
become taller before they hit the shore—until they
break on a continental shelf.
    The researchers were also able to devise a
mathematical model that describes the movement
and formation of these waves. Whereas the model is
specific to the Luzon Strait, it can still help
researchers understand how internal waves are
generated in other places around the world.
Eventually, this information will be incorporated into
global climate models, making them more accurate.
“It’s very clear, within the context of these [global
climate] models, that internal waves play a role in
driving ocean circulations,” Peacock says.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
    The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
    “What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”
    “Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
    “And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
    The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
    The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.



Question 5:
In the context of the conversation between Nawab and Harouni, Nawab’s comments in lines 43-52 (“Sir . . . beg you”) mainly serve to
A) flatter Harouni by mentioning how vast his lands are.
B) boast to Harouni about how competent and reliable Nawab is.
C) emphasize Nawab’s diligence and loyalty to Harouni.
D) notify Harouni that Nawab intends to quit his job tending the tube wells.

This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of
Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the
House of Fuji, a noble family.

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were
tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”
    “Yes?”
    “I mean to have him.”

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?



Question 32:
In the first paragraph of Passage 1, the main purpose of Douglas’s discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to
A) provide context for Douglas’s defense of continued expansion.
B) suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
C) imply that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country.
D) account for the image of the United States as powerful and admirable.

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.
Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the
only way in which capacities can be proved,—by
trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best
faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere
beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that
whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of
mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those
faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only
in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the
qualities which are not permitted to be exercised
shall not exist.



Question 36:
In Passage 2, Mill most strongly suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they
A) have long served as the basis for the formal organization of society.
B) are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
C) can be influenced by legislative reforms only indirectly.
D) benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.

This passage is adapted from Daniyal Mueenuddin,
“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.

his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could

Passage 1 is adapted from Abraham Lincoln, “Address to the
Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.” Originally
delivered in 1838. Passage 2 is from Henry David Thoreau,
“Resistance to Civil Government.” Originally published
in 1849.

Passage 1
    Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong....
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.



Question 38:
In Passage 2, Thoreau indicates that some unjust aspects of government are
A) superficial and can be fixed easily.
B) subtle and must be studied carefully.
C) self-correcting and may be beneficial.
D) inevitable and should be endured.

Passage 1 is adapted from Edmund Burke, Reflections on the
Revolution in France. Originally published in 1790. Passage 2
is adapted from Thomas Paine, Rights of Man. Originally
published in 1791.

Passage 1
    To avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and
versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of
obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have
consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions but with due
caution; that he should never dream of beginning its
reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of
a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By
this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him
into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their
poisonous weeds, and wild incantations, they may
regenerate the paternal constitution, and renovate
their father’s life.
    Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts
for objects of mere occasional interest may be
dissolved at pleasure—but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or
tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken
up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved
by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with
other reverence; because it is not a partnership in
things subservient only to the gross animal existence
of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a
partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
only between those who are living, but between those
who are living, those who are dead, and those who
are to be born. . . . The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at
their pleasure, and on their speculations of a
contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear
asunder the bands of their subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos of elementary principles.

Passage 2
    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent

the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who

as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in

inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.

This passage is adapted from Brian Greene, “How the Higgs
Boson Was Found.” ©2013 by Smithsonian Institution. The
Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the
Higgs field. Experiments conducted in 2012–2013
tentatively confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and
thus of the Higgs field.

    Nearly a half-century ago, Peter Higgs and a
handful of other physicists were trying to understand
the origin of a basic physical feature: mass. You can
think of mass as an object’s heft or, a little more
precisely, as the resistance it offers to having its
motion changed. Push on a freight train (or a
feather) to increase its speed, and the resistance you
feel reflects its mass. At a microscopic level, the
freight train’s mass comes from its constituent
molecules and atoms, which are themselves built
from fundamental particles, electrons and quarks.
But where do the masses of these and other
fundamental particles come from?
    When physicists in the 1960s modeled the
behavior of these particles using equations rooted in
quantum physics, they encountered a puzzle. If they
imagined that the particles were all massless, then
each term in the equations clicked into a perfectly
symmetric pattern, like the tips of a perfect
snowflake. And this symmetry was not just
mathematically elegant. It explained patterns evident
in the experimental data. But—and here’s the
puzzle—physicists knew that the particles did have
mass, and when they modified the equations to
account for this fact, the mathematical harmony was
spoiled. The equations became complex and
unwieldy and, worse still, inconsistent.
    What to do? Here’s the idea put forward by Higgs.
Don’t shove the particles’ masses down the throat of
the beautiful equations. Instead, keep the equations
pristine and symmetric, but consider them operating
within a peculiar environment. Imagine that all of
space is uniformly filled with an invisible
substance—now called the Higgs field—that exerts a
drag force on particles when they accelerate through
it. Push on a fundamental particle in an effort to
increase its speed and, according to Higgs, you would
feel this drag force as a resistance. Justifiably, you
would interpret the resistance as the particle’s mass.
For a mental toehold, think of a ping-pong ball
submerged in water. When you push on the
ping-pong ball, it will feel much more massive than it
does outside of water. Its interaction with the watery
environment has the effect of endowing it with mass.
So with particles submerged in the Higgs field.
    In 1964, Higgs submitted a paper to a prominent
physics journal in which he formulated this idea
mathematically. The paper was rejected. Not because
it contained a technical error, but because the
premise of an invisible something permeating space,
interacting with particles to provide their mass, well,
it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought
speculation. The editors of the journal deemed it “of
no obvious relevance to physics.”
    But Higgs persevered (and his revised paper
appeared later that year in another journal), and
physicists who took the time to study the proposal
gradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius,
one that allowed them to have their cake and eat it
too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations
can retain their pristine form because the dirty work
of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the
environment.
    While I wasn’t around to witness the initial
rejection of Higgs’s proposal in 1964 (well, I was
around, but only barely), I can attest that by the
mid-1980s, the assessment had changed. The physics
community had, for the most part, fully bought into
the idea that there was a Higgs field permeating
space. In fact, in a graduate course I took that
covered what’s known as the Standard Model of
Particle Physics (the quantum equations physicists
have assembled to describe the particles of matter
and the dominant forces by which they influence
each other), the professor presented the Higgs field
with such certainty that for a long while I had no idea
it had yet to be established experimentally.
On occasion, that happens in physics. Mathematical
equations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale,
they can seemingly radiate reality so strongly, that
they become entrenched in the vernacular of
working physicists, even before there’s data to
confirm them.

This passage is adapted from Richard J. Sharpe and Lisa
Heyden, “Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder is Possibly
Caused by a Dietary Pyrethrum Deficiency.” ©2009 by
Elsevier Ltd. Colony collapse disorder is characterized by the
disappearance of adult worker bees from hives.

    Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites).
These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can
kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility
to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Little is known about the natural defenses that keep
the mite infections under control.
    Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which
include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and
related species. These plants produce potent
insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally
occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums.
A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is
pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are
known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite
infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is
treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
    We suspect that the bees of commercial bee
colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally
deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem
is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums,
and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in
such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on
the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are
susceptible to mite infestations which can become
fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of
immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees.
This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or
fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens.
In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally
deficient bees may be further weakened when
commercially produced insecticides are introduced
into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight
mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper
dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be
better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid
pyrethrum containing plants depending on the
amount necessary to defend against mites and the
amount already consumed by the bees, which in
higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.
    This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial
wherein a small number of commercial honey bee
colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum
producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source
such as clover, while controls are offered only the
clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive
with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the
effects of the mite parasites on the experimental
colonies versus control colonies.
    It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee
colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be
some genetic difference between them that affects the
bees’ preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.

This passage is adapted from Geoffrey Giller, “Long a
Mystery, How 500-Meter-High Undersea Waves Form Is
Revealed.” ©2014 by Scientific American.

    Some of the largest ocean waves in the world are
nearly impossible to see. Unlike other large waves,
these rollers, called internal waves, do not ride the
ocean surface. Instead, they move underwater,
undetectable without the use of satellite imagery or
sophisticated monitoring equipment. Despite their
hidden nature, internal waves are fundamental parts
of ocean water dynamics, transferring heat to the
ocean depths and bringing up cold water from below.
And they can reach staggering heights—some as tall
as skyscrapers.
    Because these waves are involved in ocean mixing
and thus the transfer of heat, understanding them is
crucial to global climate modeling, says Tom
Peacock, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Most models fail to take internal
waves into account. “If we want to have more and
more accurate climate models, we have to be able to
capture processes such as this,” Peacock says.
    Peacock and his colleagues tried to do just that.
Their study, published in November in Geophysical
Research Letters, focused on internal waves generated
in the Luzon Strait, which separates Taiwan and the
Philippines. Internal waves in this region, thought to
be some of the largest in the world, can reach about
500 meters high. “That’s the same height as the
Freedom Tower that’s just been built in New York,”
Peacock says.
    Although scientists knew of this phenomenon in
the South China Sea and beyond, they didn’t know
exactly how internal waves formed. To find out,
Peacock and a team of researchers from M.I.T. and
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution worked with
France’s National Center for Scientific Research
using a giant facility there called the Coriolis
Platform. The rotating platform, about 15 meters
(49.2 feet) in diameter, turns at variable speeds and
can simulate Earth’s rotation. It also has walls, which
means scientists can fill it with water and create
accurate, large-scale simulations of various
oceanographic scenarios.
    Peacock and his team built a carbon-fiber resin
scale model of the Luzon Strait, including the islands
and surrounding ocean floor topography. Then they
filled the platform with water of varying salinity to
replicate the different densities found at the strait,
with denser, saltier water below and lighter, less
briny water above. Small particles were added to the
solution and illuminated with lights from below in
order to track how the liquid moved. Finally, they
re-created tides using two large plungers to see how
the internal waves themselves formed.
    The Luzon Strait’s underwater topography, with a
distinct double-ridge shape, turns out to be
responsible for generating the underwater waves.
As the tide rises and falls and water moves through
the strait, colder, denser water is pushed up over the
ridges into warmer, less dense layers above it.
This action results in bumps of colder water trailed
by warmer water that generate an internal wave.
As these waves move toward land, they become
steeper—much the same way waves at the beach
become taller before they hit the shore—until they
break on a continental shelf.
    The researchers were also able to devise a
mathematical model that describes the movement
and formation of these waves. Whereas the model is
specific to the Luzon Strait, it can still help
researchers understand how internal waves are
generated in other places around the world.
Eventually, this information will be incorporated into
global climate models, making them more accurate.
“It’s very clear, within the context of these [global
climate] models, that internal waves play a role in
driving ocean circulations,” Peacock says.

This passage is adapted from Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle
S. Adams, ""Money Can't Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs about
Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation."" ©2008 by Elsevier
Inc.

    Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
full force—both online and on foot—searching
frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
that their purchases will disappoint rather than
delight the intended recipients.
    Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
social process, serving various political, religious, and
psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
not very good at predicting what gifts others will
appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
psychologists. Research has found that people often
struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
projection, and multiple attribution errors.
    What is surprising is that gift-givers have
considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and
gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend
each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.
In the present research, we propose a unique
psychological explanation for this overspending
problem—i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they
spend with how much recipients will appreciate the
gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a
gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation). Although a
link between gift price and feelings of appreciation
might seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an
assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose
that gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their
feelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift
than givers assume.
    Why do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely
linked to gift-recipients’ feelings of appreciation?
Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more
expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of
thoughtfulness and consideration. According to
Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a
symbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal
their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future
relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be
motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to
send a “stronger signal” to their intended recipient.
As for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller
and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger
signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.
    The notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being
unable to account for the other party’s perspective
seems puzzling because people slip in and out of
these roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple
times in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the
extensive experience that people have as both givers
and receivers, they often struggle to transfer
information gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)
and apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as
a receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize
information about their own preferences and
experiences in order to produce more efficient
outcomes in their exchange relations. In practical
terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on
gifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift
expenditures according to personal insight.

Passage 1 is adapted from Nicholas Carr, “Author
Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains.”
©2010 by Condé Nast. Passage 2 is from Steven Pinker,
“Mind over Mass Media.” ©2010 by The New York Times

Passage 1
    The mental consequences of our online
info-crunching are not universally bad.
Certain cognitive skills are strengthened by our use
of computers and the Net. These tend to involve
more primitive mental functions, such as hand-eye
coordination, reflex response, and the processing of
visual cues. One much-cited study of video gaming
revealed that after just 10 days of playing action
games on computers, a group of young people had
significantly boosted the speed with which they could
shift their visual focus between various images and
tasks.
     It’s likely that Web browsing also strengthens
brain functions related to fast-paced problem
solving, particularly when it requires spotting
patterns in a welter of data. A British study of the
way women search for medical information online
indicated that an experienced Internet user can, at
least in some cases, assess the trustworthiness and
probable value of a Web page in a matter of seconds.
The more we practice surfing and scanning, the more
adept our brain becomes at those tasks.
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly
at such benefits and conclude that the Web is making
us smarter. In a Science article published in early
2009, prominent developmental psychologist Patricia
Greenfield reviewed more than 40 studies of the
effects of various types of media on intelligence and
learning ability. She concluded that “every medium
develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?



Question 36:
Based on Passage 2, Lincoln would be most likely to agree with which claim about the controversy over slavery?
A) It can be ended only if Northern states act unilaterally to abolish slavery throughout the United States.
B) It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.
C) It has been exacerbated by the ambiguity of laws regulating the holding of slaves.

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.



Question 2:
As compared with Silas’s gold, Eppie is portrayed as having more
A) vitality.
B) durability.
C) protection.
D) selfsufficiency.

This passage is adapted from Jeffrey Mervis, “Why Null
Results Rarely See the Light of Day.” ©2014 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.


    The question of what to do with null
results—when researchers fail to see an effect that
should be detectable—has long been hotly debated
among those conducting medical trials, where the
results can have a big impact on lives and corporate
bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to
the social and behavioral sciences, which also have
the potential to sway public and social policy.
There were little hard data, however, on how often or
why null results were squelched. “Yes, it’s true that
null results are not as exciting,” political scientist
Gary King of Harvard University says. “But I suspect
another reason they are rarely published is that there
are many, many ways to produce null results by
messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.”
    In a recent study, Stanford political economist
Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students
examined every study since 2002 that was funded by
a competitive grants program called TESS
(Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences).
TESS allows scientists to order up Internet-based
surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test
a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters
tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal
dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus
on policy matters).
    Malhotra’s team tracked down working papers
from most of the experiments that weren’t published,
and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to
their results. In their e-mailed responses, some
scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more
pressing matters—but many also believed the
journals just wouldn’t be interested. “The
unfortunate reality of the publishing world [is] that
null effects do not tell a clear story,” said one
scientist. Said another, “Never published, definitely
disappointed to not see any major effects.”
    Their answers suggest to Malhotra that rescuing
findings from the file drawer will require a shift in
expectations. “What needs to change is the
culture—the author’s belief about what will happen if
the research is written up,” he says.
    Not unexpectedly, the statistical strength of the
findings made a huge difference in whether they
were ever published. Overall, 42% of the experiments
produced statistically significant results. Of those,
62% were ultimately published, compared with 21%
of the null results. However, the Stanford team was
surprised that researchers didn’t even write up
65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.
    Scientists not involved in the study praise its
“clever” design. “It’s a very important paper” that
“starts to put numbers on things we want to
understand,” says economist Edward Miguel of the
University of California, Berkeley.
    He and others note that the bias against null
studies can waste time and money when researchers
devise new studies replicating strategies already
found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish
significant results from similar experiments in the
future, they could look stronger than they should
because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even
more troubling to Malhotra was the fact that two
scientists whose initial studies “didn’t work out”
went on to publish results based on a smaller sample.
“The non-TESS version of the same study, in which
we used a student sample, did yield fruit,” noted one
investigator.
    A registry for data generated by all experiments
would address these problems, the authors argue.
They say it should also include a “preanalysis” plan,
that is, a detailed description of what the scientist
hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed.
Such plans would help deter researchers from
tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in
search of more publishable results.



Question 18:
The last paragraph serves mainly to
A) propose a future research project to deal with some of the shortcomings of current publishing practices noted in the passage.
B) introduce a possible solution to problems discussed in the passage regarding the reporting of social science studies.
C) summarize the findings of a study about experimental results explained in the passage.
D) reinforce the importance of reexamining the results of all social science trials.

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled
with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left
to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify
the protein. Et voilà—human medicine! And, for
GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006,
becoming the world’s first transgenic animal drug.
Over the course of a year, the “milking parlors” on
GTC’s 300-acre farm in Massachusetts can collect
more than a kilogram of medicine from a single
animal.

Passage 1 is adapted from Michael Slezak, “Space Mining:
the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.



Question 42:
In lines 9-17, the author of Passage 1 mentions several companies primarily to
A) note the technological advances that make space mining possible.
B) provide evidence of the growing interest in space mining.
C) emphasize the large profits to be made from space mining.

This passage is adapted from John Bohannon, “Why You
Shouldn’t Trust Internet Comments.” ©2013 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

    The “wisdom of crowds” has become a mantra of
the Internet age. Need to choose a new vacuum
cleaner? Check out the reviews on online merchant
Amazon. But a new study suggests that such online
scores don’t always reveal the best choice. A massive
controlled experiment of Web users finds that such
ratings are highly susceptible to irrational “herd
behavior”—and that the herd can be manipulated.
Sometimes the crowd really is wiser than you. The
classic examples are guessing the weight of a bull or
the number of gumballs in a jar. Your guess is
probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the
average of many people’s choices is remarkably close
to the true number.
    But what happens when the goal is to judge
something less tangible, such as the quality or worth
of a product? According to one theory, the wisdom
of the crowd still holds—measuring the aggregate of
people’s opinions produces a stable, reliable
value. Skeptics, however, argue that people’s
opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So
nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary
opinions—for example, exposing them to some very
good or very bad attitudes—will steer the crowd in a
different direction. To test which hypothesis is true,
you would need to manipulate huge numbers of
people, exposing them to false information and
determining how it affects their opinions.
    A team led by Sinan Aral, a network scientist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, did exactly that. Aral has been secretly
working with a popular website that aggregates news
stories. The website allows users to make comments
about news stories and vote each other’s comments
up or down. The vote tallies are visible as a number
next to each comment, and the position of the
comments is chronological. (Stories on the site get an
average of about ten comments and about three votes
per comment.) It’s a follow-up to his experiment
using people’s ratings of movies to measure how
much individual people influence each other online
(answer: a lot). This time, he wanted to know how
much the crowd influences the individual, and
whether it can be controlled from outside.
    For five months, every comment submitted by a
user randomly received an “up” vote (positive); a
“down” vote (negative); or as a control, no vote at all.
The team then observed how users rated those
comments. The users generated more than
100,000 comments that were viewed more than
10 million times and rated more than 300,000 times
by other users.
    At least when it comes to comments on news
sites, the crowd is more herdlike than wise.
Comments that received fake positive votes from the
researchers were 32% more likely to receive more
positive votes compared with a control, the team
reports. And those comments were no more likely
than the control to be down-voted by the next viewer
to see them. By the end of the study, positively
manipulated comments got an overall boost of about
25%. However, the same did not hold true for
negative manipulation. The ratings of comments that
got a fake down vote were usually negated by an up
vote by the next user to see them.
    “Our experiment does not reveal the psychology
behind people’s decisions,” Aral says, “but an
intuitive explanation is that people are more
skeptical of negative social influence. They’re more
willing to go along with positive opinions from other
people.”
    Duncan Watts, a network scientist at Microsoft
Research in New York City, agrees with that
conclusion. “[But] one question is whether the
positive [herding] bias is specific to this site” or true
in general, Watts says. He points out that the
category of the news items in the experiment had a
strong effect on how much people could be
manipulated. “I would have thought that ‘business’ is
pretty similar to ‘economics,’ yet they find a much
stronger effect (almost 50% stronger) for the former
than the latter. What explains this difference? If we’re
going to apply these findings in the real world, we’ll
need to know the answers.”
    Will companies be able to boost their products by
manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?
“That is easier said than done,” Watts says. If people
detect—or learn—that comments on a website are
being manipulated, the herd may spook and leave
entirely.

This passage is adapted from Richard J. Sharpe and Lisa
Heyden, “Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder is Possibly
Caused by a Dietary Pyrethrum Deficiency.” ©2009 by
Elsevier Ltd. Colony collapse disorder is characterized by the
disappearance of adult worker bees from hives.

    Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites).
These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can
kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility
to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Little is known about the natural defenses that keep
the mite infections under control.
    Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which
include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and
related species. These plants produce potent
insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally
occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums.
A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is
pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are
known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite
infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is
treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
    We suspect that the bees of commercial bee
colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally
deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem
is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums,
and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in
such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on
the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are
susceptible to mite infestations which can become
fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of
immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees.
This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or
fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens.
In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally
deficient bees may be further weakened when
commercially produced insecticides are introduced
into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight
mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper
dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be
better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid
pyrethrum containing plants depending on the
amount necessary to defend against mites and the
amount already consumed by the bees, which in
higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.
    This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial
wherein a small number of commercial honey bee
colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum
producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source
such as clover, while controls are offered only the
clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive
with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the
effects of the mite parasites on the experimental
colonies versus control colonies.
    It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee
colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be
some genetic difference between them that affects the
bees’ preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted
incline running, and went on to document it in a
wide range of species. It not only allowed young
birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few
weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient
alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments,
adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper
than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and
onto the ceiling.
    In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on
surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop,
the Dials came up with a viable origin for the
flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding
animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the
tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for
half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the
ground-up hypothesis).



Question 29:
What can reasonably be inferred about gliding animals from the passage?
A) Their young tend to hop along beside their parents instead of flying beside them.
B) Their method of locomotion is similar to that of ground birds.
C) They use the ground for feeding more often than for perching.
D) They do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.

few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology
Line Daniel Wegner’s recent research proves that
websites—and the Internet—are changing much
more than technology itself. They are changing the
way our memories function.
    Wegner’s latest study, “Google Effects on
Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having
Information at Our Fingertips,” shows that when
people have access to search engines, they remember
fewer facts and less information because they know
they can rely on “search” as a readily available
shortcut.
    Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes
the new findings show that the Internet has become
part of a transactive memory source, a method by
which our brains compartmentalize information.
First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive
memory exists in many forms, as when a husband
relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.
“[It is] this whole network of memory where you
don’t have to remember everything in the world
yourself,” he says. “You just have to remember who
knows it.” Now computers and technology as well
are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.
    The idea validates habits already forming in our
daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary
location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars
remove the need to memorize directions.
Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our
memories too far to remember the name of an
obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan—we
just type our questions into Google. “We become
part of the Internet in a way,” he says. “We become
part of the system and we end up trusting it.”
    Working with researchers Betsy Sparrow of
Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University
of Wisconsin–Madison, Wegner conducted four
experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using
various forms of memory recall to test reliance on
computers. In the first experiment, participants
demonstrated that they were more likely to think of
computer terms like “Yahoo” or “Google” after being
asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other
experiments, participants were asked to type a
collection of readily memorable statements, such as
“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” Half the
subjects were told that their work would be saved to a
computer; the other half were informed that the
statements would be erased. In subsequent memory
testing, participants who were told their work would
not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In
a fourth experiment, participants typed into a
computer statements they were told would be saved
in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the
statements. Finally, they were given cues to the
wording and asked to name the folders where the
statements were stored. The participants proved
better able to recall the folder locations than the
statements themselves.
    Wegner concedes that questions remain about
whether dependence on computers will affect
memories negatively: “Nobody knows now what the
effects are of these tools on logical thinking.”
Students who have trouble remembering distinct
facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts
in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation
overall is beneficial, likening dependence on
computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or
other prosthetic device.
    And even though we may not be taxing our
memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using
them to consider where the facts are located and how
to access them. “We still have to remember things,”
Wegner explains. “We’re just remembering a
different range of things.” He believes his study will
lead to further research into understanding computer
dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent
of human interdependence with the computer
world—pinpointing the “movable dividing line
between us and our computers in cyber networks.”

Passage 1 is adapted from Nicholas Carr, “Author
Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains.”
©2010 by Condé Nast. Passage 2 is from Steven Pinker,
“Mind over Mass Media.” ©2010 by The New York Times

Passage 1
    The mental consequences of our online
info-crunching are not universally bad.
Certain cognitive skills are strengthened by our use
of computers and the Net. These tend to involve
more primitive mental functions, such as hand-eye
coordination, reflex response, and the processing of
visual cues. One much-cited study of video gaming
revealed that after just 10 days of playing action
games on computers, a group of young people had
significantly boosted the speed with which they could
shift their visual focus between various images and
tasks.
     It’s likely that Web browsing also strengthens
brain functions related to fast-paced problem
solving, particularly when it requires spotting
patterns in a welter of data. A British study of the
way women search for medical information online
indicated that an experienced Internet user can, at
least in some cases, assess the trustworthiness and
probable value of a Web page in a matter of seconds.
The more we practice surfing and scanning, the more
adept our brain becomes at those tasks.
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly
at such benefits and conclude that the Web is making
us smarter. In a Science article published in early
2009, prominent developmental psychologist Patricia
Greenfield reviewed more than 40 studies of the
effects of various types of media on intelligence and
learning ability. She concluded that “every medium
develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.



Question 28:
The analogy in the final sentence of Passage 2 has primarily which effect?
A) It uses ornate language to illustrate a difficult concept.
B) It employs humor to soften a severe opinion of human behavior.
C) It alludes to the past to evoke a nostalgic response.
D) It criticizes the view of a particular group.

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

This passage is from Charlotte Brontë, The Professor,
originally published in 1857.

    No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a
mistake in the choice of his profession, and every
man, worthy of the name, will row long against wind
and tide before he allows himself to cry out, “I am
baffled!” and submits to be floated passively back to
land. From the first week of my residence in X—
felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself—the
work of copying and translating business-letters—
was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been
all, I should long have borne with the nuisance; I am
not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the
double desire of getting my living and justifying to
myself and others the resolution I had taken to
become a tradesman, I should have endured in
silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I
should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I
longed for liberty; I should have pent in every sigh by
which my heart might have ventured to intimate its
distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and
joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the
tender and the mighty, should never, either by
softness or strength, have severed me. But this was
not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between
myself and my employer striking deeper root and
spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from
every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to
feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the
slimy walls of a well.
    Antipathy is the only word which can express the
feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in
a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to
be excited by every, the most trifling movement,
look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed
him; the degree of education evinced in my language
irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and
accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high
flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I
too should one day make a successful tradesman.
Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not
have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he
knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he
was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a
ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have
forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three
faculties—Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling
and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never
baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels.
Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it
would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its
slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.
    I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was
returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul
with the pleasant feeling that the master who had
paid me grudged every penny of that hard‑earned
pittance—(I had long ceased to regard
Mr. Crimsworth as my brother—he was a hard,
grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable
tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong,
occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me;
again and again they uttered the same monotonous
phrases. One said: “William, your life is intolerable.”
The other: “What can you do to alter it?” I walked
fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I
approached my lodgings, I turned from a general
view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to
whether my fire would be out; looking towards the
window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red
gleam.

The main purpose of the opening sentence of the passage is to
A) establish the narrator’s perspective on a controversy.

This passage is adapted from Virginia Woolf, Three Guineas.
©1938 by Harcourt, Inc. Here, Woolf considers the situation
of women in English society.

    Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames,
an admirable vantage ground for us to make a
survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden
with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other,
Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a
place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not
now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession—the procession of the sons of educated
men.
    There they go, our brothers who have been
educated at public schools and universities,
mounting those steps, passing in and out of those
doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine,
transacting business, making money. It is a solemn
sight always—a procession, like a caravanserai
crossing a desert. . . . But now, for the past twenty
years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a
photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of
time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic
appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that
makes a difference. We who have looked so long at
the pageant in books, or from a curtained window
watched educated men leaving the house at about
nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house
at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively
no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount
those steps, pass in and out of those doors,... make
money, administer justice. . . . We who now agitate
these humble pens may in another century or two
speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine
spirit—a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say
whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in
military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old
family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that
venerable object was never decorated with plumes of
white horsehair. You laugh—indeed the shadow of
the private house still makes those dresses look a
little queer. We have worn private clothes so
long. . . . But we have not come here to laugh, or to
talk of fashions—men’s and women’s. We are here,
on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions.
And they are very important questions; and we have
very little time in which to answer them. The
questions that we have to ask and to answer about
that procession during this moment of transition are
so important that they may well change the lives of
all men and women for ever. For we have to ask
ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don’t we? On what terms shall we join
that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the
procession of educated men? The moment is short; it
may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a
matter of a few months longer.... But, you will
object, you have no time to think; you have your
battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to
organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam.
As you know from your own experience, and there
are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men
have always done their thinking from hand to
mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought
while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the
cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our
brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on
thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think
we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while
we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations
and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think . . . in the
gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts;
let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals.
Let us never cease from thinking—what is this
“civilization” in which we find ourselves? What are
these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why
should we make money out of them? Where in
short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of
educated men?



Question 36:
Woolf indicates that the procession she describes in the passage
A) has come to have more practical influence in recent years.
B) has become a celebrated feature of English public life.
C) includes all of the richest and most powerful men in England.
D) has become less exclusionary in its membership in recent years.

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.

joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the
tender and the mighty, should never, either by
softness or strength, have severed me. But this was
not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between
myself and my employer striking deeper root and
spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from
every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to
feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the
slimy walls of a well.
    Antipathy is the only word which can express the
feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in
a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to
be excited by every, the most trifling movement,
look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed
him; the degree of education evinced in my language
irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and
accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high
flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I
too should one day make a successful tradesman.
Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not
have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he
knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he
was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a
ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have
forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three
faculties—Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling
and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never
baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels.
Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it
would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its
slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.
    I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was
returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul
with the pleasant feeling that the master who had
paid me grudged every penny of that hard‑earned
pittance—(I had long ceased to regard
Mr. Crimsworth as my brother—he was a hard,
grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable
tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong,
occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me;
again and again they uttered the same monotonous
phrases. One said: “William, your life is intolerable.”
The other: “What can you do to alter it?” I walked
fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I
approached my lodgings, I turned from a general
view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to
whether my fire would be out; looking towards the
window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red
gleam.

This passage is adapted from Jeffrey Mervis, “Why Null
Results Rarely See the Light of Day.” ©2014 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.


    The question of what to do with null
results—when researchers fail to see an effect that
should be detectable—has long been hotly debated
among those conducting medical trials, where the
results can have a big impact on lives and corporate
bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to
the social and behavioral sciences, which also have
the potential to sway public and social policy.
There were little hard data, however, on how often or
why null results were squelched. “Yes, it’s true that
null results are not as exciting,” political scientist
Gary King of Harvard University says. “But I suspect
another reason they are rarely published is that there
are many, many ways to produce null results by
messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.”
    In a recent study, Stanford political economist
Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students
examined every study since 2002 that was funded by
a competitive grants program called TESS
(Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences).
TESS allows scientists to order up Internet-based
surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test
a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters
tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal
dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus
on policy matters).
    Malhotra’s team tracked down working papers
from most of the experiments that weren’t published,
and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to
their results. In their e-mailed responses, some
scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more
pressing matters—but many also believed the
journals just wouldn’t be interested. “The
unfortunate reality of the publishing world [is] that
null effects do not tell a clear story,” said one
scientist. Said another, “Never published, definitely
disappointed to not see any major effects.”
    Their answers suggest to Malhotra that rescuing
findings from the file drawer will require a shift in
expectations. “What needs to change is the
culture—the author’s belief about what will happen if
the research is written up,” he says.
    Not unexpectedly, the statistical strength of the
findings made a huge difference in whether they
were ever published. Overall, 42% of the experiments
produced statistically significant results. Of those,
62% were ultimately published, compared with 21%
of the null results. However, the Stanford team was
surprised that researchers didn’t even write up
65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.
    Scientists not involved in the study praise its
“clever” design. “It’s a very important paper” that
“starts to put numbers on things we want to
understand,” says economist Edward Miguel of the
University of California, Berkeley.
    He and others note that the bias against null
studies can waste time and money when researchers
devise new studies replicating strategies already
found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish
significant results from similar experiments in the
future, they could look stronger than they should
because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even
more troubling to Malhotra was the fact that two
scientists whose initial studies “didn’t work out”
went on to publish results based on a smaller sample.
“The non-TESS version of the same study, in which
we used a student sample, did yield fruit,” noted one
investigator.
    A registry for data generated by all experiments
would address these problems, the authors argue.
They say it should also include a “preanalysis” plan,
that is, a detailed description of what the scientist
hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed.
Such plans would help deter researchers from
tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in
search of more publishable results.

This passage is adapted from Amy Tan, The Bonesetter’s
Daughter. ©2001 by Amy Tan.

    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.

This passage is from Charlotte Brontë, The Professor,
originally published in 1857.

    No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a
mistake in the choice of his profession, and every
man, worthy of the name, will row long against wind
and tide before he allows himself to cry out, “I am
baffled!” and submits to be floated passively back to
land. From the first week of my residence in X—
felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself—the
work of copying and translating business-letters—
was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been
all, I should long have borne with the nuisance; I am
not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the
double desire of getting my living and justifying to
myself and others the resolution I had taken to
become a tradesman, I should have endured in
silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I
should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I
longed for liberty; I should have pent in every sigh by
which my heart might have ventured to intimate its
distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and
joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the

Passage 1 is adapted from Edmund Burke, Reflections on the
Revolution in France. Originally published in 1790. Passage 2
is adapted from Thomas Paine, Rights of Man. Originally
published in 1791.

Passage 1
    To avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and
versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of
obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have
consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions but with due
caution; that he should never dream of beginning its
reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of
a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By
this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him
into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their
poisonous weeds, and wild incantations, they may
regenerate the paternal constitution, and renovate
their father’s life.
    Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts
for objects of mere occasional interest may be
dissolved at pleasure—but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or
tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken
up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved
by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with
other reverence; because it is not a partnership in
things subservient only to the gross animal existence
of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a
partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
only between those who are living, but between those
who are living, those who are dead, and those who
are to be born. . . . The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at
their pleasure, and on their speculations of a
contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear
asunder the bands of their subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos of elementary principles.

Passage 2
    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is
the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who
are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each
other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagination
can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can
exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid
down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence,
and the other not in, and who never can meet in this
world, that the one should control the other to the
end of time?...
    The circumstances of the world are continually
changing, and the opinions of men change also; and
as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in
one age, may be thought wrong and found
inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to
decide, the living, or the dead?



Question 33:
As used in line 4, “state” most nearly refers to a
A) style of living.
B) position in life.
C) temporary condition.
D) political entity.

This passage is adapted from Daniyal Mueenuddin,
“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
    The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
    “What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”
    “Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
    “And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
    The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
    The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.



Question 7:
It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that Harouni provides Nawab with a motorcycle mainly because
A) Harouni appreciates that Nawab has to work hard to support his family.
B) Harouni sees benefit to himself from giving Nawab a motorcycle.
C) Nawab’s speech is the most eloquent that Harouni has ever heard.
D) Nawab threatens to quit if Harouni doesn’t agree to give him a motorcycle.

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is
adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....
    Consider, sir, dispassionately, these
observations—for a glimpse of this truth seemed to
open before you when you observed, “that to see one
half of the human race excluded by the other from all
participation of government, was a political
phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it
was impossible to explain.” If so, on what does your
constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will
bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by
a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same
test: though a different opinion prevails in this
country, built on the very arguments which you use
to justify the oppression of woman—prescription.
    Consider—I address you as a legislator—
whether, when men contend for their freedom, and
to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their
own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to
subjugate women, even though you firmly believe
that you are acting in the manner best calculated to
promote their happiness? Who made man the
exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift
of reason?
    In this style, argue tyrants of every
denomination, from the weak king to the weak
father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason;
yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be
useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force
all women, by denying them civil and political rights,
to remain immured in their families groping in
the dark?

In Passage 2, the author claims that freedoms granted by society’s leaders have

This passage is adapted from Iain King, “Can Economics Be
Ethical?” ©2013 by Prospect Publishing.

    Recent debates about the economy have
rediscovered the question, “is that right?”, where
“right” means more than just profits or efficiency.
Some argue that because the free markets allow
for personal choice, they are already ethical. Others
have accepted the ethical critique and embraced
corporate social responsibility. But before we can
label any market outcome as “immoral,” or sneer at
economists who try to put a price on being ethical,
we need to be clear on what we are talking about.
    There are different views on where ethics should
apply when someone makes an economic decision.
Consider Adam Smith, widely regarded as the
founder of modern economics. He was a moral
philosopher who believed sympathy for others was
the basis for ethics (we would call it empathy
nowadays). But one of his key insights in The Wealth
of Nations was that acting on this empathy could be
counter-productive—he observed people becoming
better off when they put their own empathy aside,
and interacted in a self-interested way. Smith justifies
selfish behavior by the outcome. Whenever planners
use cost-benefit analysis to justify a new railway line,
or someone retrains to boost his or her earning
power, or a shopper buys one to get one free, they are
using the same approach: empathizing with
someone, and seeking an outcome that makes that
person as well off as possible—although the person
they are empathizing with may be themselves in the
future.
   Instead of judging consequences, Aristotle
said ethics was about having the right
character—displaying virtues like courage and
honesty. It is a view put into practice whenever
business leaders are chosen for their good character.
But it is a hard philosophy to teach—just how much
loyalty should you show to a manufacturer that keeps
losing money? Show too little and you’re a “greed is
good” corporate raider; too much and you’re wasting
money on unproductive capital. Aristotle thought
there was a golden mean between the two extremes,
and finding it was a matter of fine judgment. But if
ethics is about character, it’s not clear what those
characteristics should be.
    There is yet another approach: instead of rooting
ethics in character or the consequences of actions, we
can focus on our actions themselves. From this
perspective some things are right, some wrong—we
should buy fair trade goods, we shouldn’t tell lies in
advertisements. Ethics becomes a list of
commandments, a catalog of “dos” and “don’ts.”
When a finance official refuses to devalue a currency
because they have promised not to, they are defining
ethics this way. According to this approach
devaluation can still be bad, even if it would make
everybody better off.
    Many moral dilemmas arise when these three
versions pull in different directions but clashes are
not inevitable. Take fair trade coffee (coffee that is
sold with a certification that indicates the farmers
and workers who produced it were paid a fair wage),
for example: buying it might have good
consequences, be virtuous, and also be the right way
to act in a flawed market. Common ground like this
suggests that, even without agreement on where
ethics applies, ethical economics is still possible.
    Whenever we feel queasy about “perfect”
competitive markets, the problem is often rooted in a
phony conception of people. The model of man on
which classical economics is based—an entirely
rational and selfish being—is a parody, as
John Stuart Mill, the philosopher who pioneered the
model, accepted. Most people—even economists—
now accept that this “economic man” is a fiction.
We behave like a herd; we fear losses more than we
hope for gains; rarely can our brains process all the
relevant facts.
    These human quirks mean we can never make
purely “rational” decisions. A new wave of behavioral
economists, aided by neuroscientists, is trying to
understand our psychology, both alone and in
groups, so they can anticipate our decisions in the
marketplace more accurately. But psychology can
also help us understand why we react in disgust at
economic injustice, or accept a moral law as
universal. Which means that the relatively new
science of human behavior might also define ethics
for us. Ethical economics would then emerge from
one of the least likely places: economists themselves.

The main idea of the final paragraph is that
A) human quirks make it difficult to predict people’s ethical decisions accurately.
B) people universally react with disgust when faced with economic injustice.

Passage 1 is adapted from Nicholas Carr, “Author
Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains.”
©2010 by Condé Nast. Passage 2 is from Steven Pinker,
“Mind over Mass Media.” ©2010 by The New York Times

Passage 1
    The mental consequences of our online
info-crunching are not universally bad.
Certain cognitive skills are strengthened by our use
of computers and the Net. These tend to involve
more primitive mental functions, such as hand-eye
coordination, reflex response, and the processing of
visual cues. One much-cited study of video gaming
revealed that after just 10 days of playing action
games on computers, a group of young people had
significantly boosted the speed with which they could
shift their visual focus between various images and
tasks.
     It’s likely that Web browsing also strengthens
brain functions related to fast-paced problem
solving, particularly when it requires spotting
patterns in a welter of data. A British study of the
way women search for medical information online
indicated that an experienced Internet user can, at
least in some cases, assess the trustworthiness and
probable value of a Web page in a matter of seconds.
The more we practice surfing and scanning, the more
adept our brain becomes at those tasks.
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly
at such benefits and conclude that the Web is making
us smarter. In a Science article published in early
2009, prominent developmental psychologist Patricia
Greenfield reviewed more than 40 studies of the
effects of various types of media on intelligence and
learning ability. She concluded that “every medium
develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.

This passage is adapted from Taras Grescoe, Straphanger:
Saving Our Cities and Ourselves from the Automobile. ©2012
by Taras Grescoe.

    Though there are 600 million cars on the planet,
and counting, there are also seven billion people,
which means that for the vast majority of us getting
around involves taking buses, ferryboats, commuter
trains, streetcars, and subways. In other words,
traveling to work, school, or the market means being
a straphanger: somebody who, by choice or necessity,
relies on public transport, rather than a privately
owned automobile.
    Half the population of New York, Toronto, and
London do not own cars. Public transport is how
most of the people of Asia and Africa, the world’s
most populous continents, travel. Every day, subway
systems carry 155 million passengers, thirty-four
times the number carried by all the world’s airplanes,
and the global public transport market is now valued
at $428 billion annually. A century and a half after
the invention of the internal combustion engine,
private car ownership is still an anomaly.
    And yet public transportation, in many minds, is
the opposite of glamour—a squalid last resort for
those with one too many impaired driving charges,
too poor to afford insurance, or too decrepit to get
behind the wheel of a car. In much of North
America, they are right: taking transit is a depressing
experience. Anybody who has waited far too long on
a street corner for the privilege of boarding a
lurching, overcrowded bus, or wrestled luggage onto
subways and shuttles to get to a big city airport,
knows that transit on this continent tends to be
underfunded, ill-maintained, and ill-planned. Given
the opportunity, who wouldn’t drive? Hopping in a
car almost always gets you to your destination more
quickly.
    It doesn’t have to be like this. Done right, public
transport can be faster, more comfortable, and
cheaper than the private automobile. In Shanghai,
German-made magnetic levitation trains skim over
elevated tracks at 266 miles an hour, whisking people
to the airport at a third of the speed of sound. In
provincial French towns, electric-powered streetcars
run silently on rubber tires, sliding through narrow
streets along a single guide rail set into cobblestones.
From Spain to Sweden, Wi-Fi equipped high-speed
trains seamlessly connect with highly ramified metro
networks, allowing commuters to work on laptops as
they prepare for same-day meetings in once distant
capital cities. In Latin America, China, and India,
working people board fast-loading buses that move
like subway trains along dedicated busways, leaving
the sedans and SUVs of the rich mired in
dawn-to-dusk traffic jams. And some cities have
transformed their streets into cycle-path freeways,
making giant strides in public health and safety and
the sheer livability of their neighborhoods—in the
process turning the workaday bicycle into a viable
form of mass transit.
    If you credit the demographers, this transit trend
has legs. The “Millenials,” who reached adulthood
around the turn of the century and now outnumber
baby boomers, tend to favor cities over suburbs, and
are far more willing than their parents to ride buses
and subways. Part of the reason is their ease with
iPads, MP3 players, Kindles, and smartphones: you
can get some serious texting done when you’re not
driving, and earbuds offer effective insulation from
all but the most extreme commuting annoyances.
Even though there are more teenagers in the country
than ever, only ten million have a driver’s license
(versus twelve million a generation ago). Baby
boomers may have been raised in Leave It to Beaver
suburbs, but as they retire, a significant contingent is
favoring older cities and compact towns where they
have the option of walking and riding bikes. Seniors,
too, are more likely to use transit, and by 2025, there
will be 64 million Americans over the age of
sixty-five. Already, dwellings in older neighborhoods
in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Denver, especially
those near light-rail or subway stations, are
commanding enormous price premiums over
suburban homes. The experience of European and
Asian cities shows that if you make buses, subways,
and trains convenient, comfortable, fast, and safe, a
surprisingly large percentage of citizens will opt to
ride rather than drive.

This passage is adapted from “How the Web Affects
Memory.” ©2011 by Harvard Magazine Inc.


    Search engines have changed the way we use the
Internet, putting vast sources of information just a
few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology
Line Daniel Wegner’s recent research proves that
websites—and the Internet—are changing much
more than technology itself. They are changing the
way our memories function.
    Wegner’s latest study, “Google Effects on
Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having
Information at Our Fingertips,” shows that when
people have access to search engines, they remember
fewer facts and less information because they know
they can rely on “search” as a readily available
shortcut.
    Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes
the new findings show that the Internet has become
part of a transactive memory source, a method by
which our brains compartmentalize information.
First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive
memory exists in many forms, as when a husband
relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.
“[It is] this whole network of memory where you
don’t have to remember everything in the world
yourself,” he says. “You just have to remember who
knows it.” Now computers and technology as well
are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.
    The idea validates habits already forming in our
daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary
location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars
remove the need to memorize directions.
Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our
memories too far to remember the name of an
obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan—we
just type our questions into Google. “We become
part of the Internet in a way,” he says. “We become
part of the system and we end up trusting it.”
    Working with researchers Betsy Sparrow of
Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University
of Wisconsin–Madison, Wegner conducted four
experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using
various forms of memory recall to test reliance on
computers. In the first experiment, participants
demonstrated that they were more likely to think of
computer terms like “Yahoo” or “Google” after being
asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other
experiments, participants were asked to type a
collection of readily memorable statements, such as
“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” Half the
subjects were told that their work would be saved to a
computer; the other half were informed that the
statements would be erased. In subsequent memory
testing, participants who were told their work would
not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In
a fourth experiment, participants typed into a
computer statements they were told would be saved
in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the
statements. Finally, they were given cues to the
wording and asked to name the folders where the
statements were stored. The participants proved
better able to recall the folder locations than the
statements themselves.
    Wegner concedes that questions remain about
whether dependence on computers will affect
memories negatively: “Nobody knows now what the
effects are of these tools on logical thinking.”
Students who have trouble remembering distinct
facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts
in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation
overall is beneficial, likening dependence on
computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or
other prosthetic device.
    And even though we may not be taxing our
memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using
them to consider where the facts are located and how
to access them. “We still have to remember things,”
Wegner explains. “We’re just remembering a
different range of things.” He believes his study will
lead to further research into understanding computer
dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent
of human interdependence with the computer
world—pinpointing the “movable dividing line
between us and our computers in cyber networks.”



Question 13:
In context, the reference to remembering a relative’s birthday mainly serves to
A) show that people who are closely related tend to have shared memories.
B) demonstrate how people initially developed external sources of memory.
C) emphasize the effectiveness and accuracy of transactive memory sources.

This passage is adapted from David Owen, The Conundrum:
How Scientific Innovation, Increased Efficiency, and Good
Intentions Can Make Our Energy and Climate Problems Worse.
©2011 by David Owen.

    Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
Line prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
    One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control
measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
    Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
    One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself—the
work of copying and translating business-letters—
was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been
all, I should long have borne with the nuisance; I am
not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the
double desire of getting my living and justifying to
myself and others the resolution I had taken to
become a tradesman, I should have endured in
silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I
should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I
longed for liberty; I should have pent in every sigh by
which my heart might have ventured to intimate its
distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and
joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the
tender and the mighty, should never, either by
softness or strength, have severed me. But this was
not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between
myself and my employer striking deeper root and
spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from
every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to
feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the
slimy walls of a well.
    Antipathy is the only word which can express the
feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in
a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to
be excited by every, the most trifling movement,
look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed
him; the degree of education evinced in my language
irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and
accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high
flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I
too should one day make a successful tradesman.
Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not
have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he
knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he
was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a
ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have
forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three
faculties—Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling
and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never
baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels.
Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it
would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its
slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.
    I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was
returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul
with the pleasant feeling that the master who had
paid me grudged every penny of that hard‑earned
pittance—(I had long ceased to regard
Mr. Crimsworth as my brother—he was a hard,
grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable
tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong,
occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me;
again and again they uttered the same monotonous
phrases. One said: “William, your life is intolerable.”
The other: “What can you do to alter it?” I walked
fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I
approached my lodgings, I turned from a general
view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to
whether my fire would be out; looking towards the
window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red
gleam.

This passage is adapted from Iain King, “Can Economics Be
Ethical?” ©2013 by Prospect Publishing.

    Recent debates about the economy have
rediscovered the question, “is that right?”, where
“right” means more than just profits or efficiency.
Some argue that because the free markets allow
for personal choice, they are already ethical. Others
have accepted the ethical critique and embraced
corporate social responsibility. But before we can
label any market outcome as “immoral,” or sneer at
economists who try to put a price on being ethical,
we need to be clear on what we are talking about.
    There are different views on where ethics should
apply when someone makes an economic decision.
Consider Adam Smith, widely regarded as the
founder of modern economics. He was a moral
philosopher who believed sympathy for others was
the basis for ethics (we would call it empathy
nowadays). But one of his key insights in The Wealth
of Nations was that acting on this empathy could be
counter-productive—he observed people becoming
better off when they put their own empathy aside,
and interacted in a self-interested way. Smith justifies
selfish behavior by the outcome. Whenever planners
use cost-benefit analysis to justify a new railway line,
or someone retrains to boost his or her earning
power, or a shopper buys one to get one free, they are
using the same approach: empathizing with
someone, and seeking an outcome that makes that
person as well off as possible—although the person
they are empathizing with may be themselves in the
future.
   Instead of judging consequences, Aristotle
said ethics was about having the right
character—displaying virtues like courage and
honesty. It is a view put into practice whenever
business leaders are chosen for their good character.
But it is a hard philosophy to teach—just how much
loyalty should you show to a manufacturer that keeps
losing money? Show too little and you’re a “greed is
good” corporate raider; too much and you’re wasting
money on unproductive capital. Aristotle thought
there was a golden mean between the two extremes,
and finding it was a matter of fine judgment. But if
ethics is about character, it’s not clear what those
characteristics should be.
    There is yet another approach: instead of rooting
ethics in character or the consequences of actions, we
can focus on our actions themselves. From this
perspective some things are right, some wrong—we
should buy fair trade goods, we shouldn’t tell lies in
advertisements. Ethics becomes a list of
commandments, a catalog of “dos” and “don’ts.”
When a finance official refuses to devalue a currency
because they have promised not to, they are defining
ethics this way. According to this approach
devaluation can still be bad, even if it would make
everybody better off.
    Many moral dilemmas arise when these three
versions pull in different directions but clashes are
not inevitable. Take fair trade coffee (coffee that is
sold with a certification that indicates the farmers
and workers who produced it were paid a fair wage),
for example: buying it might have good
consequences, be virtuous, and also be the right way
to act in a flawed market. Common ground like this
suggests that, even without agreement on where
ethics applies, ethical economics is still possible.
    Whenever we feel queasy about “perfect”
competitive markets, the problem is often rooted in a
phony conception of people. The model of man on
which classical economics is based—an entirely
rational and selfish being—is a parody, as
John Stuart Mill, the philosopher who pioneered the
model, accepted. Most people—even economists—
now accept that this “economic man” is a fiction.
We behave like a herd; we fear losses more than we
hope for gains; rarely can our brains process all the
relevant facts.
    These human quirks mean we can never make
purely “rational” decisions. A new wave of behavioral
economists, aided by neuroscientists, is trying to
understand our psychology, both alone and in
groups, so they can anticipate our decisions in the
marketplace more accurately. But psychology can
also help us understand why we react in disgust at
economic injustice, or accept a moral law as
universal. Which means that the relatively new
science of human behavior might also define ethics
for us. Ethical economics would then emerge from
one of the least likely places: economists themselves.



Question 15:
The main purpose of the fifth paragraph (lines 45-56) is to
A) develop a counterargument to the claim that greed is good.
B) provide support for the idea that ethics is about character.
C) describe a third approach to defining ethical economics.
D) illustrate that one’s actions are a result of one’s character.

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”

This passage is adapted from Daniel Chamovitz, What a
Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses. ©2012 by
Daniel Chamovitz

    The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
    We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.



Question 47:
According to the passage, which statement best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close?
A) The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
B) The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
C) The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
D) The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

This passage is adapted from John Bohannon, “Why You
Shouldn’t Trust Internet Comments.” ©2013 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

    The “wisdom of crowds” has become a mantra of
the Internet age. Need to choose a new vacuum
cleaner? Check out the reviews on online merchant
Amazon. But a new study suggests that such online
scores don’t always reveal the best choice. A massive
controlled experiment of Web users finds that such
ratings are highly susceptible to irrational “herd
behavior”—and that the herd can be manipulated.
Sometimes the crowd really is wiser than you. The
classic examples are guessing the weight of a bull or
the number of gumballs in a jar. Your guess is
probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the
average of many people’s choices is remarkably close
to the true number.
    But what happens when the goal is to judge
something less tangible, such as the quality or worth
of a product? According to one theory, the wisdom
of the crowd still holds—measuring the aggregate of
people’s opinions produces a stable, reliable
value. Skeptics, however, argue that people’s
opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So
nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary
opinions—for example, exposing them to some very
good or very bad attitudes—will steer the crowd in a
different direction. To test which hypothesis is true,
you would need to manipulate huge numbers of
people, exposing them to false information and
determining how it affects their opinions.
    A team led by Sinan Aral, a network scientist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, did exactly that. Aral has been secretly
working with a popular website that aggregates news
stories. The website allows users to make comments
about news stories and vote each other’s comments
up or down. The vote tallies are visible as a number
next to each comment, and the position of the
comments is chronological. (Stories on the site get an
average of about ten comments and about three votes
per comment.) It’s a follow-up to his experiment
using people’s ratings of movies to measure how
much individual people influence each other online
(answer: a lot). This time, he wanted to know how
much the crowd influences the individual, and
whether it can be controlled from outside.
    For five months, every comment submitted by a
user randomly received an “up” vote (positive); a
“down” vote (negative); or as a control, no vote at all.
The team then observed how users rated those
comments. The users generated more than
100,000 comments that were viewed more than
10 million times and rated more than 300,000 times
by other users.
    At least when it comes to comments on news
sites, the crowd is more herdlike than wise.
Comments that received fake positive votes from the
researchers were 32% more likely to receive more
positive votes compared with a control, the team
reports. And those comments were no more likely
than the control to be down-voted by the next viewer
to see them. By the end of the study, positively
manipulated comments got an overall boost of about
25%. However, the same did not hold true for
negative manipulation. The ratings of comments that
got a fake down vote were usually negated by an up
vote by the next user to see them.
    “Our experiment does not reveal the psychology
behind people’s decisions,” Aral says, “but an
intuitive explanation is that people are more
skeptical of negative social influence. They’re more
willing to go along with positive opinions from other
people.”
    Duncan Watts, a network scientist at Microsoft
Research in New York City, agrees with that
conclusion. “[But] one question is whether the
positive [herding] bias is specific to this site” or true
in general, Watts says. He points out that the
category of the news items in the experiment had a
strong effect on how much people could be
manipulated. “I would have thought that ‘business’ is
pretty similar to ‘economics,’ yet they find a much
stronger effect (almost 50% stronger) for the former
than the latter. What explains this difference? If we’re
going to apply these findings in the real world, we’ll
need to know the answers.”
    Will companies be able to boost their products by
manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?
“That is easier said than done,” Watts says. If people
detect—or learn—that comments on a website are
being manipulated, the herd may spook and leave
entirely.



Question 36:
Which action would best address a question Watts raises about the study?

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.

In describing the relationship between Eppie and Silas, the narrator draws a connection between Eppie’s
A) physical vulnerability and Silas’s emotional fragility.

Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the

knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt

tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”

This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of
Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the
House of Fuji, a noble family.

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were

This passage is adapted from Peter A. Ensminger, Life Under
the Sun. ©2001 by Peter A. Ensminger.

    Many millennia before the invention of
herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to
control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a
Line valuable part of an integrated weed-management
program. Although plowing kills standing weeds,
farmers have long known that it often leads to the
emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.
    Ecologists have shown that a farmer’s field can
have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter
buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists
have shown that seeds buried more than about one
centimeter below the soil surface do not receive
enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow,
which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil
surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the
surface where their germination is induced by
exposure to sunlight?
    Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn
Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a
relatively simple experiment, they went to ten
different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and
collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the
soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred
up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then
exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a
greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples,
weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in
light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives
weed seeds a “light break,” and this stimulates their
germination.
    More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen
University in Germany reasoned that when farmers
plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed
seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is
turned over, and that this stimulates their
germination. Although the light exposures from
plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can
be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the
germination of weed seeds would be minimized if
farmers simply plowed their fields during the night,
when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which
photons hit the surface] is below 10^15 photons per
square meter per second. Although even under these
conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike
each square millimeter of ground each second, this
illumination is below the threshold needed to
stimulate the germination of most seeds.
    Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when
he first came up with this idea because he assumed
that such a simple method of weed control as
plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would
have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent
experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific
meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated
that the method can be effective.
    Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two
agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated
threefold, at around midday and the other strip
at night. No crops were planted in these pilot
experiments, to avoid possible competition with
the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic.
More than 80 percent of the surface of the field
plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas
only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was
covered by weeds.
    This method of weed control is currently being
used by several farmers in Germany. Because many
of the same weed species that invade farmers’ fields
in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world,
this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact,
recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon,
Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina
support this idea.

Passage 1 is adapted from a speech delivered in 1898 by
Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is
adapted from a speech delivered in 1900 by William
Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.



Question 40:
Which choice best describes a central difference between how Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) view the concept of liberty as it is realized in the United States?
A) Beveridge presents it as the direct inheritance of European colonization, whereas Bryan presents it as a sharp break from earlier governments in Europe.
B) Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.
C) Beveridge argues that it arose organically as the United States matured, whereas Bryan argues that it was present from the country’s beginnings.
D) Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.

Passage 1 is Beecher’s response to Grimké’s views.
Passage 2 is Grimké’s response to Beecher.

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.



Question 11:
In Passage 1, Beecher makes which point about the status of women relative to that of men?
A) Women depend on men for their safety and security, but men are largely independent of women.
B) Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
C) Women have fewer rights than men do, but women also have fewer responsibilities.
D) Women are superior to men, but tradition requires women to obey men.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted
incline running, and went on to document it in a
wide range of species. It not only allowed young
birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few
weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient
alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments,
adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper
than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and
onto the ceiling.
    In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on
surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop,
the Dials came up with a viable origin for the
flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding
animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the
tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for
half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the
ground-up hypothesis).



Question 23:
Which statement best captures Ken Dial’s central assumption in setting up his research?
A) The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
B) The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.
C) Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
D) Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel.

This passage is adapted from Geoffrey Giller, “Long a
Mystery, How 500-Meter-High Undersea Waves Form Is
Revealed.” ©2014 by Scientific American.

    Some of the largest ocean waves in the world are
nearly impossible to see. Unlike other large waves,
these rollers, called internal waves, do not ride the
ocean surface. Instead, they move underwater,
undetectable without the use of satellite imagery or
sophisticated monitoring equipment. Despite their
hidden nature, internal waves are fundamental parts
of ocean water dynamics, transferring heat to the
ocean depths and bringing up cold water from below.
And they can reach staggering heights—some as tall
as skyscrapers.
    Because these waves are involved in ocean mixing
and thus the transfer of heat, understanding them is
crucial to global climate modeling, says Tom
Peacock, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Most models fail to take internal
waves into account. “If we want to have more and
more accurate climate models, we have to be able to
capture processes such as this,” Peacock says.
    Peacock and his colleagues tried to do just that.
Their study, published in November in Geophysical
Research Letters, focused on internal waves generated
in the Luzon Strait, which separates Taiwan and the
Philippines. Internal waves in this region, thought to
be some of the largest in the world, can reach about
500 meters high. “That’s the same height as the
Freedom Tower that’s just been built in New York,”
Peacock says.
    Although scientists knew of this phenomenon in
the South China Sea and beyond, they didn’t know
exactly how internal waves formed. To find out,
Peacock and a team of researchers from M.I.T. and
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution worked with
France’s National Center for Scientific Research
using a giant facility there called the Coriolis
Platform. The rotating platform, about 15 meters
(49.2 feet) in diameter, turns at variable speeds and
can simulate Earth’s rotation. It also has walls, which
means scientists can fill it with water and create
accurate, large-scale simulations of various
oceanographic scenarios.
    Peacock and his team built a carbon-fiber resin
scale model of the Luzon Strait, including the islands
and surrounding ocean floor topography. Then they
filled the platform with water of varying salinity to
replicate the different densities found at the strait,
with denser, saltier water below and lighter, less
briny water above. Small particles were added to the
solution and illuminated with lights from below in
order to track how the liquid moved. Finally, they
re-created tides using two large plungers to see how
the internal waves themselves formed.
    The Luzon Strait’s underwater topography, with a
distinct double-ridge shape, turns out to be
responsible for generating the underwater waves.
As the tide rises and falls and water moves through
the strait, colder, denser water is pushed up over the
ridges into warmer, less dense layers above it.
This action results in bumps of colder water trailed
by warmer water that generate an internal wave.
As these waves move toward land, they become
steeper—much the same way waves at the beach
become taller before they hit the shore—until they
break on a continental shelf.
    The researchers were also able to devise a
mathematical model that describes the movement
and formation of these waves. Whereas the model is
specific to the Luzon Strait, it can still help
researchers understand how internal waves are
generated in other places around the world.
Eventually, this information will be incorporated into
global climate models, making them more accurate.
“It’s very clear, within the context of these [global
climate] models, that internal waves play a role in
driving ocean circulations,” Peacock says.

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?



Question 33:
What does Passage 1 suggest about the US government’s provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution?
A) They included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states.
B) They anticipated the Union’s expansion into western territories.

This passage is adapted from Stephen Coleman, Scott
Anthony, and David E. Morrison, “Public Trust in the News.”
©2009 by Stephen Coleman.

    The news is a form of public knowledge.
Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the
health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a
private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge
increases in value as it is shared by more people. The
date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;
the causes and consequences of an environmental
disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular
law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all
examples of public knowledge that people are
generally expected to know in order to be considered
informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or
private knowledge, which is generally left to
individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is
promoted even to those who might not think it
matters to them. In short, the circulation of public
knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded
as a public good which cannot be solely
demand-driven.
    The production, circulation, and reception
of public knowledge is a complex process. It is
generally accepted that public knowledge should
be authoritative, but there is not always
common agreement about what the public needs to
know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and
how authoritative reputations should be determined
and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The
Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely
regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative
agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied
the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of
authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the
opinions of others.” As part of the general process of
the transformation of authority whereby there has
been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional
sources of public knowledge, the demand has been
for all authority to make explicit the frames of value
which determine their decisions. Centres of news
production, as our focus groups show, have not been
exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps
some news journalists feel uneasy about this
renegotiation of their authority:
    Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the
    “most read” lists on their own and other websites
    to work out which stories matter to readers and
    viewers. And now the audience—which used to
    know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of
    journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our
    credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008).
    The result of democratising access to TV news
    could be political disengagement by the majority
    and a dumbing down through a popularity
    contest of stories (online news editor, 2007).
    Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,
they amount to more than straightforward
professional defensiveness. In their reference to an
audience “which used to know its place” and
conflation between democratisation and “dumbing
down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular
mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by
experts, immune from populist pressures; and
disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive
recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down
opportunities for popular involvement in the making
of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional
claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are
right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every
institutional level in contemporary society,
scepticism towards the epistemological authority of
expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed
by several of our focus group participants, that the
news media should be “informative rather than
authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to
“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their
slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient
information” from which “we would be able to form
opinions of our own.”
    At stake here are two distinct conceptions of
authority. The journalists we have quoted are
resistant to the democratisation of news:
the supremacy of the clickstream (according to
which editors raise or lower the profile of stories
according to the number of readers clicking on them
online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”
news; the demands of some audience members for
raw news rather than constructed narratives.

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.

This passage is adapted from Richard J. Sharpe and Lisa
Heyden, “Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder is Possibly
Caused by a Dietary Pyrethrum Deficiency.” ©2009 by
Elsevier Ltd. Colony collapse disorder is characterized by the
disappearance of adult worker bees from hives.

    Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites).
These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can
kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility
to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Little is known about the natural defenses that keep
the mite infections under control.
    Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which
include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and
related species. These plants produce potent
insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally
occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums.
A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is
pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are
known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite
infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is
treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
    We suspect that the bees of commercial bee
colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally
deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem
is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums,
and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in
such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on
the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are
susceptible to mite infestations which can become
fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of
immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees.
This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or
fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens.
In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally
deficient bees may be further weakened when
commercially produced insecticides are introduced
into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight
mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper
dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be
better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid
pyrethrum containing plants depending on the
amount necessary to defend against mites and the
amount already consumed by the bees, which in
higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.
    This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial
wherein a small number of commercial honey bee
colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum
producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source
such as clover, while controls are offered only the
clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive
with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the
effects of the mite parasites on the experimental
colonies versus control colonies.
    It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee
colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be
some genetic difference between them that affects the
bees’ preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled
with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left
to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify
the protein. Et voilà—human medicine! And, for
GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006,
becoming the world’s first transgenic animal drug.
Over the course of a year, the “milking parlors” on
GTC’s 300-acre farm in Massachusetts can collect
more than a kilogram of medicine from a single
animal.



Question 29:
Which of the following does the author suggest about the “female goats” mentioned in line 59?
A) They secreted antithrombin in their milk after giving birth.
B) Some of their kids were not born with the antithrombin gene.
C) They were the first animals to receive microinjections.
D) Their cells already contained genes usually found in humans.

Passage 1 is adapted from Michael Slezak, “Space Mining:
the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.



Question 52:
Which point about the resources that will be highly valued in space is implicit in Passage 1 and explicit in Passage 2?
A) They may be different resources from those that are valuable on Earth.
B) They will be valuable only if they can be harvested cheaply.

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”




Question 29:
What is a main idea of the seventh paragraph (lines 62-73)?
A) Different types of hierarchies exist in each flock of birds.
B) Mistakes can happen when long-winged birds create a V formation.
C) Future research will help scientists to better understand V formations.
D) Long-winged birds watch the lead bird closely to keep a V formation intact.

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.
Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the
only way in which capacities can be proved,—by
trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best
faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere
beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that
whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of
mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those
faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only
in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the
qualities which are not permitted to be exercised
shall not exist.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted
incline running, and went on to document it in a
wide range of species. It not only allowed young
birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few
weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient
alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments,
adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper
than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and
onto the ceiling.
    In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on
surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop,
the Dials came up with a viable origin for the
flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding
animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the
tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for
half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the
ground-up hypothesis).



Question 27:
The passage identifies which of the following as a factor that facilitated the baby Chukars’ traction on steep ramps?
A) The speed with which they climbed
B) The position of their flapping wings
C) The alternation of wing and foot movement
D) Their continual hopping motions

Passage 1 is adapted from a speech delivered in 1898 by
Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is
adapted from a speech delivered in 1900 by William
Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

A) accuse fellow abolitionists of overlooking the contributions that women have made to the movement.
B) argue that the causes of abolition and women’s rights are continuations of the spirit of the American Revolution.

This passage is adapted from Richard J. Sharpe and Lisa
Heyden, “Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder is Possibly
Caused by a Dietary Pyrethrum Deficiency.” ©2009 by
Elsevier Ltd. Colony collapse disorder is characterized by the
disappearance of adult worker bees from hives.

    Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites).
These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can
kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility
to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Little is known about the natural defenses that keep
the mite infections under control.
    Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which
include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and
related species. These plants produce potent
insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally
occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums.
A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is
pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are
known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite
infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is
treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
    We suspect that the bees of commercial bee
colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally
deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem
is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums,
and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in
such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on
the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are
susceptible to mite infestations which can become
fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of
immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees.
This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or
fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens.
In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally
deficient bees may be further weakened when
commercially produced insecticides are introduced
into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight
mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper
dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be
better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid
pyrethrum containing plants depending on the
amount necessary to defend against mites and the
amount already consumed by the bees, which in
higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.
    This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial
wherein a small number of commercial honey bee
colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum
producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source
such as clover, while controls are offered only the
clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive
with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the
effects of the mite parasites on the experimental
colonies versus control colonies.
    It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee
colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be
some genetic difference between them that affects the
bees’ preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.

Passage 1 is adapted from Michael Slezak, “Space Mining:
the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.



Question 50:
The author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the discussion of the future of space mining in lines 18-28, Passage 1, by claiming that such a future
A) is inconsistent with the sustainable use of space resources.
B) will be difficult to bring about in the absence of regulations.
C) cannot be attained without technologies that do not yet exist.
D) seems certain to affect Earth’s economy in a negative way.

This passage is adapted from David Owen, The Conundrum:
How Scientific Innovation, Increased Efficiency, and Good
Intentions Can Make Our Energy and Climate Problems Worse.
©2011 by David Owen.

    Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
Line prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
    One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control
measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
    Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
    One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

This passage is adapted from “How the Web Affects
Memory.” ©2011 by Harvard Magazine Inc.


    Search engines have changed the way we use the
Internet, putting vast sources of information just a
few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology
Line Daniel Wegner’s recent research proves that
websites—and the Internet—are changing much
more than technology itself. They are changing the
way our memories function.
    Wegner’s latest study, “Google Effects on
Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having
Information at Our Fingertips,” shows that when
people have access to search engines, they remember
fewer facts and less information because they know
they can rely on “search” as a readily available
shortcut.
    Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes
the new findings show that the Internet has become
part of a transactive memory source, a method by
which our brains compartmentalize information.
First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive
memory exists in many forms, as when a husband
relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.
“[It is] this whole network of memory where you
don’t have to remember everything in the world
yourself,” he says. “You just have to remember who
knows it.” Now computers and technology as well
are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.
    The idea validates habits already forming in our
daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary
location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars
remove the need to memorize directions.
Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our
memories too far to remember the name of an
obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan—we
just type our questions into Google. “We become
part of the Internet in a way,” he says. “We become
part of the system and we end up trusting it.”
    Working with researchers Betsy Sparrow of
Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University
of Wisconsin–Madison, Wegner conducted four
experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using
various forms of memory recall to test reliance on
computers. In the first experiment, participants
demonstrated that they were more likely to think of
computer terms like “Yahoo” or “Google” after being
asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other
experiments, participants were asked to type a
collection of readily memorable statements, such as
“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” Half the
subjects were told that their work would be saved to a
computer; the other half were informed that the
statements would be erased. In subsequent memory
testing, participants who were told their work would
not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In
a fourth experiment, participants typed into a
computer statements they were told would be saved
in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the
statements. Finally, they were given cues to the
wording and asked to name the folders where the
statements were stored. The participants proved
better able to recall the folder locations than the
statements themselves.
    Wegner concedes that questions remain about
whether dependence on computers will affect
memories negatively: “Nobody knows now what the
effects are of these tools on logical thinking.”
Students who have trouble remembering distinct
facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts
in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation
overall is beneficial, likening dependence on
computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or
other prosthetic device.
    And even though we may not be taxing our
memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using
them to consider where the facts are located and how
to access them. “We still have to remember things,”
Wegner explains. “We’re just remembering a
different range of things.” He believes his study will
lead to further research into understanding computer
dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent
of human interdependence with the computer
world—pinpointing the “movable dividing line
between us and our computers in cyber networks.”

Based on the information in the passage, which of the following would be considered a transactive memory source?

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.



Question 46:
The author of Passage 2 would most likely agree with which statement about the development of teixobactin?
A) It reveals that some antibiotics are effective against gram-negative bacteria.
B) It shows that conventional methods can still yield new types of antibiotics.
C) It casts doubt on the practicality of searching for new antibiotics in exotic environments.
D) It confirms a long-held belief about a potential source of new antibiotics.

This passage is adapted from Mary Helen Stefaniak, The
Cailiffs of Baghdad, Georgia: A Novel. ©2010 by Mary Helen
Stefaniak.

    Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”



Question 6:
The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to
A) suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.
B) establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor.

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.

Based on the passages, both authors would agree with which of the following claims?

Passage 1 is adapted from Abraham Lincoln, “Address to the
Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.” Originally
delivered in 1838. Passage 2 is from Henry David Thoreau,
“Resistance to Civil Government.” Originally published
in 1849.

Passage 1
    Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong....
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.

This passage is adapted from Marlene Zuk, Paleofantasy:
What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We
Live. ©2013 by Marlene Zuk.

    A female guppy can be sexually mature at two
months of age and have her first babies just a month
later. This unstinting rate of reproduction makes
Line guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of
evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC
Riverside, has been doing exactly that for the last few
decades.
    People usually think of guppies as colorful
aquarium fish, but they also have a life in the real
world, inhabiting streams and rivers in tropical
places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his
fieldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of
conditions depending on the luck of the draw.
A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of
rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike
cichlids found in calmer downstream waters. As you
might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the
proportion of individuals that die—is much higher in
the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those
without them.
    Reznick has shown that if you bring the fish into
the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from
the sites with many predators become sexually
mature when they are younger and smaller than do
the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition,
the litters of baby guppies produced by mothers from
the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual
baby is smaller than those produced by their
counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if
you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have
babies sooner, and spreading your energy reserves
over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will
manage to pass on some of your genes before you
meet your fate. Reznick and other scientists also
demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the
guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which they
grow up.
    How quickly, though, could these differences in
how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have
evolved? Because there are numerous tributaries of
the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some
but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as
he put it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test
tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places
they had not originally occurred, and then watch as
natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called
“experimental evolution,” and it is growing
increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for
humans to be able to see the outcome within our
lifetimes.
    Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick
removed groups of guppies from their predator
ridden lives below the waterfall and released them
into previously guppy-free streams above the falls.
Although small predatory killifish occurred in these
new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the
danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for
nature to do its work, and they brought the
descendants of the transplanted fish back to the lab
to examine their reproduction. After just eleven
years, the guppies released in the new streams had
evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger
offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that
naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams.
Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown
evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years,
or a little over four generations, with more time
required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability
to form schools and less time for changes in the
colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.

In describing the living conditions of guppies, the author indicates that a “lucky guppy” (line 14) is one that

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”




Question 26:
What is the most likely reason the author includes the 30 cm measurement in line 30?
A) To demonstrate the accuracy with which the data loggers collected the data

Passage 1 is adapted from a speech delivered in 1898 by
Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is
adapted from a speech delivered in 1900 by William
Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.

This passage is from Charlotte Brontë, The Professor,
originally published in 1857.

    No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a
mistake in the choice of his profession, and every
man, worthy of the name, will row long against wind
and tide before he allows himself to cry out, “I am
baffled!” and submits to be floated passively back to
land. From the first week of my residence in X—
felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself—the
work of copying and translating business-letters—
was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been
all, I should long have borne with the nuisance; I am
not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the
double desire of getting my living and justifying to
myself and others the resolution I had taken to
become a tradesman, I should have endured in
silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I
should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I
longed for liberty; I should have pent in every sigh by
which my heart might have ventured to intimate its
distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and
joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the
tender and the mighty, should never, either by
softness or strength, have severed me. But this was
not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between
myself and my employer striking deeper root and
spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from
every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to
feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the
slimy walls of a well.
    Antipathy is the only word which can express the
feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in
a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to
be excited by every, the most trifling movement,
look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed
him; the degree of education evinced in my language
irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and
accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high
flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I
too should one day make a successful tradesman.
Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not
have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he
knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he
was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a
ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have
forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three
faculties—Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling
and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never
baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels.
Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it
would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its
slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.
    I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was
returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul
with the pleasant feeling that the master who had
paid me grudged every penny of that hard‑earned
pittance—(I had long ceased to regard
Mr. Crimsworth as my brother—he was a hard,
grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable
tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong,
occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me;
again and again they uttered the same monotonous
phrases. One said: “William, your life is intolerable.”
The other: “What can you do to alter it?” I walked
fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I
approached my lodgings, I turned from a general
view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to
whether my fire would be out; looking towards the
window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red
gleam.

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,

—regardless of whether they also repelled

weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”




Question 27:
What does the author imply about pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation?
A) They communicate with each other in the same way as do ibises.
B) They have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
C) They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
D) They expend more energy than do ibises.

This passage is adapted from Peter A. Ensminger, Life Under
the Sun. ©2001 by Peter A. Ensminger.

    Many millennia before the invention of
herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to
control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a
Line valuable part of an integrated weed-management
program. Although plowing kills standing weeds,
farmers have long known that it often leads to the
emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.
    Ecologists have shown that a farmer’s field can
have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter
buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists
have shown that seeds buried more than about one
centimeter below the soil surface do not receive
enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow,
which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil
surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the
surface where their germination is induced by
exposure to sunlight?
    Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn
Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a
relatively simple experiment, they went to ten
different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and
collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the
soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred
up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then
exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a
greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples,
weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in
light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives
weed seeds a “light break,” and this stimulates their
germination.
    More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen
University in Germany reasoned that when farmers
plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed
seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is
turned over, and that this stimulates their
germination. Although the light exposures from
plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can
be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the
germination of weed seeds would be minimized if
farmers simply plowed their fields during the night,
when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which
photons hit the surface] is below 10^15 photons per
square meter per second. Although even under these
conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike
each square millimeter of ground each second, this
illumination is below the threshold needed to
stimulate the germination of most seeds.
    Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when
he first came up with this idea because he assumed
that such a simple method of weed control as
plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would
have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent
experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific
meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated
that the method can be effective.
    Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two
agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated
threefold, at around midday and the other strip
at night. No crops were planted in these pilot
experiments, to avoid possible competition with
the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic.
More than 80 percent of the surface of the field
plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas
only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was
covered by weeds.
    This method of weed control is currently being
used by several farmers in Germany. Because many
of the same weed species that invade farmers’ fields
in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world,
this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact,
recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon,
Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina
support this idea.

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

This passage is adapted from John Bohannon, “Why You
Shouldn’t Trust Internet Comments.” ©2013 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

    The “wisdom of crowds” has become a mantra of
the Internet age. Need to choose a new vacuum
cleaner? Check out the reviews on online merchant
Amazon. But a new study suggests that such online
scores don’t always reveal the best choice. A massive
controlled experiment of Web users finds that such
ratings are highly susceptible to irrational “herd
behavior”—and that the herd can be manipulated.
Sometimes the crowd really is wiser than you. The
classic examples are guessing the weight of a bull or
the number of gumballs in a jar. Your guess is
probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the
average of many people’s choices is remarkably close
to the true number.
    But what happens when the goal is to judge
something less tangible, such as the quality or worth
of a product? According to one theory, the wisdom
of the crowd still holds—measuring the aggregate of
people’s opinions produces a stable, reliable
value. Skeptics, however, argue that people’s
opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So
nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary
opinions—for example, exposing them to some very
good or very bad attitudes—will steer the crowd in a
different direction. To test which hypothesis is true,
you would need to manipulate huge numbers of
people, exposing them to false information and
determining how it affects their opinions.
    A team led by Sinan Aral, a network scientist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, did exactly that. Aral has been secretly
working with a popular website that aggregates news
stories. The website allows users to make comments
about news stories and vote each other’s comments
up or down. The vote tallies are visible as a number
next to each comment, and the position of the
comments is chronological. (Stories on the site get an
average of about ten comments and about three votes
per comment.) It’s a follow-up to his experiment
using people’s ratings of movies to measure how
much individual people influence each other online
(answer: a lot). This time, he wanted to know how
much the crowd influences the individual, and
whether it can be controlled from outside.
    For five months, every comment submitted by a
user randomly received an “up” vote (positive); a
“down” vote (negative); or as a control, no vote at all.
The team then observed how users rated those
comments. The users generated more than
100,000 comments that were viewed more than
10 million times and rated more than 300,000 times
by other users.
    At least when it comes to comments on news
sites, the crowd is more herdlike than wise.
Comments that received fake positive votes from the
researchers were 32% more likely to receive more
positive votes compared with a control, the team
reports. And those comments were no more likely
than the control to be down-voted by the next viewer
to see them. By the end of the study, positively
manipulated comments got an overall boost of about
25%. However, the same did not hold true for
negative manipulation. The ratings of comments that
got a fake down vote were usually negated by an up
vote by the next user to see them.
    “Our experiment does not reveal the psychology
behind people’s decisions,” Aral says, “but an
intuitive explanation is that people are more
skeptical of negative social influence. They’re more
willing to go along with positive opinions from other
people.”
    Duncan Watts, a network scientist at Microsoft
Research in New York City, agrees with that
conclusion. “[But] one question is whether the
positive [herding] bias is specific to this site” or true
in general, Watts says. He points out that the
category of the news items in the experiment had a
strong effect on how much people could be
manipulated. “I would have thought that ‘business’ is
pretty similar to ‘economics,’ yet they find a much
stronger effect (almost 50% stronger) for the former
than the latter. What explains this difference? If we’re
going to apply these findings in the real world, we’ll
need to know the answers.”
    Will companies be able to boost their products by
manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?
“That is easier said than done,” Watts says. If people
detect—or learn—that comments on a website are
being manipulated, the herd may spook and leave
entirely.

The author of the passage suggests that crowds may be more effective at

This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of
Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the
House of Fuji, a noble family.

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were
tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”
    “Yes?”
    “I mean to have him.”

This passage is adapted from Stephen Coleman, Scott
Anthony, and David E. Morrison, “Public Trust in the News.”
©2009 by Stephen Coleman.

    The news is a form of public knowledge.
Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the
health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a
private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge
increases in value as it is shared by more people. The
date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;
the causes and consequences of an environmental
disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular
law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all
examples of public knowledge that people are
generally expected to know in order to be considered
informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or
private knowledge, which is generally left to
individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is
promoted even to those who might not think it
matters to them. In short, the circulation of public
knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded
as a public good which cannot be solely
demand-driven.
    The production, circulation, and reception
of public knowledge is a complex process. It is
generally accepted that public knowledge should
be authoritative, but there is not always
common agreement about what the public needs to
know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and
how authoritative reputations should be determined
and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The
Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely
regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative
agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied
the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of
authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the
opinions of others.” As part of the general process of
the transformation of authority whereby there has
been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional
sources of public knowledge, the demand has been
for all authority to make explicit the frames of value
which determine their decisions. Centres of news
production, as our focus groups show, have not been
exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps
some news journalists feel uneasy about this
renegotiation of their authority:
    Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the
    “most read” lists on their own and other websites
    to work out which stories matter to readers and
    viewers. And now the audience—which used to
    know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of
    journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our
    credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008).
    The result of democratising access to TV news
    could be political disengagement by the majority
    and a dumbing down through a popularity
    contest of stories (online news editor, 2007).
    Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,
they amount to more than straightforward
professional defensiveness. In their reference to an
audience “which used to know its place” and
conflation between democratisation and “dumbing
down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular
mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by
experts, immune from populist pressures; and
disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive
recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down
opportunities for popular involvement in the making
of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional
claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are
right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every
institutional level in contemporary society,
scepticism towards the epistemological authority of
expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed
by several of our focus group participants, that the
news media should be “informative rather than
authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to
“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their
slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient
information” from which “we would be able to form
opinions of our own.”
    At stake here are two distinct conceptions of
authority. The journalists we have quoted are
resistant to the democratisation of news:
the supremacy of the clickstream (according to
which editors raise or lower the profile of stories
according to the number of readers clicking on them
online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”
news; the demands of some audience members for
raw news rather than constructed narratives.

This passage is adapted from Brian Greene, “How the Higgs
Boson Was Found.” ©2013 by Smithsonian Institution. The
Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the
Higgs field. Experiments conducted in 2012–2013
tentatively confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and
thus of the Higgs field.

    Nearly a half-century ago, Peter Higgs and a
handful of other physicists were trying to understand
the origin of a basic physical feature: mass. You can
think of mass as an object’s heft or, a little more
precisely, as the resistance it offers to having its
motion changed. Push on a freight train (or a
feather) to increase its speed, and the resistance you
feel reflects its mass. At a microscopic level, the
freight train’s mass comes from its constituent
molecules and atoms, which are themselves built
from fundamental particles, electrons and quarks.
But where do the masses of these and other
fundamental particles come from?
    When physicists in the 1960s modeled the
behavior of these particles using equations rooted in
quantum physics, they encountered a puzzle. If they
imagined that the particles were all massless, then
each term in the equations clicked into a perfectly
symmetric pattern, like the tips of a perfect
snowflake. And this symmetry was not just
mathematically elegant. It explained patterns evident
in the experimental data. But—and here’s the
puzzle—physicists knew that the particles did have
mass, and when they modified the equations to
account for this fact, the mathematical harmony was
spoiled. The equations became complex and
unwieldy and, worse still, inconsistent.
    What to do? Here’s the idea put forward by Higgs.
Don’t shove the particles’ masses down the throat of
the beautiful equations. Instead, keep the equations
pristine and symmetric, but consider them operating
within a peculiar environment. Imagine that all of
space is uniformly filled with an invisible
substance—now called the Higgs field—that exerts a
drag force on particles when they accelerate through
it. Push on a fundamental particle in an effort to
increase its speed and, according to Higgs, you would
feel this drag force as a resistance. Justifiably, you
would interpret the resistance as the particle’s mass.
For a mental toehold, think of a ping-pong ball
submerged in water. When you push on the
ping-pong ball, it will feel much more massive than it
does outside of water. Its interaction with the watery
environment has the effect of endowing it with mass.
So with particles submerged in the Higgs field.
    In 1964, Higgs submitted a paper to a prominent
physics journal in which he formulated this idea
mathematically. The paper was rejected. Not because
it contained a technical error, but because the
premise of an invisible something permeating space,
interacting with particles to provide their mass, well,
it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought
speculation. The editors of the journal deemed it “of
no obvious relevance to physics.”
    But Higgs persevered (and his revised paper
appeared later that year in another journal), and
physicists who took the time to study the proposal
gradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius,
one that allowed them to have their cake and eat it
too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations
can retain their pristine form because the dirty work
of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the
environment.
    While I wasn’t around to witness the initial
rejection of Higgs’s proposal in 1964 (well, I was
around, but only barely), I can attest that by the
mid-1980s, the assessment had changed. The physics
community had, for the most part, fully bought into
the idea that there was a Higgs field permeating
space. In fact, in a graduate course I took that
covered what’s known as the Standard Model of
Particle Physics (the quantum equations physicists
have assembled to describe the particles of matter
and the dominant forces by which they influence
each other), the professor presented the Higgs field
with such certainty that for a long while I had no idea
it had yet to be established experimentally.
On occasion, that happens in physics. Mathematical
equations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale,
they can seemingly radiate reality so strongly, that
they become entrenched in the vernacular of
working physicists, even before there’s data to
confirm them.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.





Question 3:
With which of the following statements about his father would the narrator most likely agree?
A) He lacked affection for the narrator.
B) He disliked any unnecessary use of money.
C) He would not have approved of Sempere’s gift.
D) He objected to the writings of Charles Dickens.

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the
Texas gourd study.



Question 24:
Which statement about striped cucumber beetles can most reasonably be inferred from the passage?
A) They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
B) They are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are.
C) They experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
D) They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.

During the summer of 1897, the narrator of this story, a
fictional Swedish scientist, has set out for the North Pole
in a hydrogen-powered balloon.

    My emotions are complicated and not
readily verifiable. I feel a vast yearning that is
simultaneously a pleasure and a pain. I am certain
of the consummation of this yearning, but I don’t
know yet what form it will take, since I do not
understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.
For the first time there is borne in upon me the full
truth of what I myself said to the doctor only an hour
ago: that my motives in this undertaking are not
entirely clear. For years, for a lifetime, the machinery
of my destiny has worked in secret to prepare for this
moment; its clockwork has moved exactly toward
this time and place and no other. Rising slowly from
the earth that bore me and gave me sustenance, I am
carried helplessly toward an uninhabited and hostile,
or at best indifferent, part of the earth, littered with
the bones of explorers and the wrecks of ships, frozen
supply caches, messages scrawled with chilled fingers
and hidden in cairns that no eye will ever see.
Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have
died. Yet in freely willing this enterprise, in choosing
this moment and no other when the south wind
will carry me exactly northward at a velocity of
eight knots, I have converted the machinery of my
fate into the servant of my will. All this I understand,
as I understand each detail of the technique by which
this is carried out. What I don’t understand is why I
am so intent on going to this particular place. Who
wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat
it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like
a railway? The Danish ministers have declared from
their pulpits that participation in polar expeditions is
beneficial to the soul’s eternal well-being, or so I read
in a newspaper. It isn’t clear how this doctrine is to
be interpreted, except that the Pole is something
difficult or impossible to attain which must
nevertheless be sought for, because man is
condemned to seek out and know everything
whether or not the knowledge gives him pleasure. In
short, it is the same unthinking lust for knowledge
that drove our First Parents out of the garden.
    And suppose you were to find it in spite of all, this
wonderful place that everybody is so anxious to stand
on! What would you find? Exactly nothing.
A point precisely identical to all the others in a
completely featureless wasteland stretching around it
for hundreds of miles. It is an abstraction, a
mathematical fiction. No one but a Swedish madman
could take the slightest interest in it. Here I am. The
wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily
northward at the speed of a trotting dog. Behind us,
perhaps forever, lie the Cities of Men with their
teacups and their brass bedsteads. I am going forth of
my own volition to join the ghosts of Bering and
poor Franklin, of frozen De Long and his men.
What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not
an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself. The
doctor was right, even though I dislike him.
Fundamentally I am a dangerous madman, and what

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.

This passage is adapted from Virginia Woolf, Three Guineas.
©1938 by Harcourt, Inc. Here, Woolf considers the situation
of women in English society.

    Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames,
an admirable vantage ground for us to make a
survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden
with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other,
Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a
place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not
now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession—the procession of the sons of educated
men.
    There they go, our brothers who have been
educated at public schools and universities,
mounting those steps, passing in and out of those
doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine,
transacting business, making money. It is a solemn
sight always—a procession, like a caravanserai
crossing a desert. . . . But now, for the past twenty
years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a
photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of
time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic
appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that
makes a difference. We who have looked so long at
the pageant in books, or from a curtained window
watched educated men leaving the house at about
nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house
at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively
no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount
those steps, pass in and out of those doors,... make
money, administer justice. . . . We who now agitate
these humble pens may in another century or two
speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine
spirit—a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say
whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in
military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old
family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that
venerable object was never decorated with plumes of
white horsehair. You laugh—indeed the shadow of
the private house still makes those dresses look a
little queer. We have worn private clothes so
long. . . . But we have not come here to laugh, or to
talk of fashions—men’s and women’s. We are here,
on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions.
And they are very important questions; and we have
very little time in which to answer them. The
questions that we have to ask and to answer about
that procession during this moment of transition are
so important that they may well change the lives of
all men and women for ever. For we have to ask
ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don’t we? On what terms shall we join
that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the
procession of educated men? The moment is short; it
may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a
matter of a few months longer.... But, you will
object, you have no time to think; you have your
battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to
organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam.
As you know from your own experience, and there
are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men
have always done their thinking from hand to
mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought
while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the
cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our
brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on
thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think
we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while
we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations
and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think . . . in the
gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts;
let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals.
Let us never cease from thinking—what is this
“civilization” in which we find ourselves? What are
these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why
should we make money out of them? Where in
short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of
educated men?

Passage 1 is adapted from Abraham Lincoln, “Address to the
Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.” Originally
delivered in 1838. Passage 2 is from Henry David Thoreau,
“Resistance to Civil Government.” Originally published
in 1849.

Passage 1
    Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will

Passage 1 is adapted from Abraham Lincoln, “Address to the
Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.” Originally
delivered in 1838. Passage 2 is from Henry David Thoreau,
“Resistance to Civil Government.” Originally published
in 1849.

Passage 1
    Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong....
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?



Question 39:
Which choice identifies a central tension between the two passages?
A) Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support.
B) Douglas expresses concerns about the economic impact of abolition, but Lincoln dismisses those concerns as irrelevant.
C) Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.
D) Douglas offers an interpretation of federal law that conflicts with Lincoln’s, and Lincoln implies that Douglas’s interpretation is poorly reasoned.

This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of
Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the
House of Fuji, a noble family.

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were
tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”
    “Yes?”
    “I mean to have him.”

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

C) Contributing to their family’s financial security while meeting social expectations

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.



Question 5:
According to the narrator, one consequence of Silas adopting Eppie is that he
A) has renounced all desire for money.
B) better understands his place in nature.
C) seems more accepting of help from others.
D) looks forward to a different kind of future.

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.



Question 6:
The narrator indicates that Lymie finally closes the history book because
A) his father has joined him at the table.
B) the people at the other table are too disruptive.
C) he has finished the chapter about the Congress.
D) he is preparing to leave the restaurant.

qThis passage is adapted from Carolyn Gramling, “Source of
Mysterious Medieval Eruption Identified.” ©2013 by
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

    About 750 years ago, a powerful volcano erupted
somewhere on Earth, kicking off a centuries-long
cold snap known as the Little Ice Age. Identifying the
volcano responsible has been tricky.
    That a powerful volcano erupted somewhere in
the world, sometime in the Middle Ages, is written in
polar ice cores in the form of layers of sulfate
deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass. These
cores suggest that the amount of sulfur the mystery
volcano sent into the stratosphere put it firmly
among the ranks of the strongest climate-perturbing
eruptions of the current geological epoch, the
Holocene, a period that stretches from 10,000 years
ago to the present. A haze of stratospheric sulfur
cools the climate by reflecting solar energy back into
space.
    In 2012, a team of scientists led by geochemist
Gifford Miller strengthened the link between the
mystery eruption and the onset of the Little Ice Age
by using radiocarbon dating of dead plant material
from beneath the ice caps on Baffin Island and
Iceland, as well as ice and sediment core data, to
determine that the cold summers and ice growth
began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 C.E. (and
became intensified between 1430 and 1455 C.E.).
Such a sudden onset pointed to a huge volcanic
eruption injecting sulfur into the stratosphere and
starting the cooling. Subsequent, unusually large and
frequent eruptions of other volcanoes, as well as
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks persisting long after the
aerosols have been removed from the atmosphere,
may have prolonged the cooling through the 1700s.
    Volcanologist Franck Lavigne and colleagues now
think they’ve identified the volcano in question:
Indonesia’s Samalas. One line of evidence, they note,
is historical records. According to Babad Lombok,
records of the island written on palm leaves in Old
Javanese, Samalas erupted catastrophically before the
end of the 13th century, devastating surrounding
villages—including Lombok’s capital at the time,
Pamatan—with ash and fast-moving sweeps of hot
rock and gas called pyroclastic flows.
    The researchers then began to reconstruct the
formation of the large, 800-meter-deep caldera [a
basin-shaped volcanic crater] that now sits atop the
volcano. They examined 130 outcrops on the flanks
of the volcano, exposing sequences of pumice—ash
hardened into rock—and other pyroclastic material.
The volume of ash deposited, and the estimated
height of the eruption plume (43 kilometers above
sea level) put the eruption’s magnitude at a
minimum of 7 on the volcanic explosivity index
(which has a scale of 1 to 8)—making it one of the
largest known in the Holocene.
    The team also performed radiocarbon analyses on
carbonized tree trunks and branches buried within
the pyroclastic deposits to confirm the date of the
eruption; it could not, they concluded, have
happened before 1257 C.E., and certainly happened
in the 13th century.
    It’s not a total surprise that an Indonesian volcano
might be the source of the eruption, Miller says. “An
equatorial eruption is more consistent with the
apparent climate impacts.” And, he adds, with sulfate
appearing in both polar ice caps—Arctic and
Antarctic—there is “a strong consensus” that this
also supports an equatorial source.
    Another possible candidate—both in terms of
timing and geographical location—is Ecuador’s
Quilotoa, estimated to have last erupted between
1147 and 1320 C.E. But when Lavigne’s team
examined shards of volcanic glass from this volcano,
they found that they didn’t match the chemical
composition of the glass found in polar ice cores,
whereas the Samalas glass is a much closer match.
That, they suggest, further strengthens the case that
Samalas was responsible for the medieval “year
without summer” in 1258 C.E.

This passage is adapted from David Rotman, “How
Technology Is Destroying Jobs.” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    MIT business scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee have argued that impressive
advances in computer technology—from improved
industrial robotics to automated translation
services—are largely behind the sluggish
employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
more ominous for workers, they foresee dismal
prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful
new technologies are increasingly adopted not only
in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in
professions such as law, financial services, education,
and medicine.
    That robots, automation, and software can replace
people might seem obvious to anyone who’s worked
in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But
Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s claim is more troubling
and controversial. They believe that rapid
technological change has been destroying jobs faster
than it is creating them, contributing to the
stagnation of median income and the growth of
inequality in the United States. And, they suspect,
something similar is happening in other
technologically advanced countries.
    As evidence, Brynjolfsson and McAfee point to a
chart that only an economist could love. In
economics, productivity—the amount of economic
value created for a given unit of input, such as an
hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and
wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the
chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines
represent productivity and total employment in the
United States. For years after World War II, the
two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in
jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The
pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value
from their workers, the country as a whole became
richer, which fueled more economic activity and
created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the
lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,
but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a
significant gap appears between the two lines,
showing economic growth with no parallel increase
in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the
“great decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is
confident that technology is behind both the healthy
growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.
    It’s a startling assertion because it threatens the
faith that many economists place in technological
progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that
technology boosts productivity and makes societies
wealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark
side: technological progress is eliminating the need
for many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker
worse off than before. Brynjolfsson can point to a
second chart indicating that median income is failing
to rise even as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s
the great paradox of our era,” he says. “Productivity
is at record levels, innovation has never been faster,
and yet at the same time, we have a falling median
income and we have fewer jobs. People are falling
behind because technology is advancing so fast and
our skills and organizations aren’t keeping up.”
    While technological changes can be painful for
workers whose skills no longer match the needs of
employers, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist,
says that no historical pattern shows these shifts
leading to a net decrease in jobs over an extended
period. Katz has done extensive research on how
technological advances have affected jobs over the
last few centuries—describing, for example, how
highly skilled artisans in the mid-19th century were
displaced by lower-skilled workers in factories.
While it can take decades for workers to acquire the
expertise needed for new types of employment, he
says, “we never have run out of jobs. There is no
long-term trend of eliminating work for people. Over
the long term, employment rates are fairly
stable. People have always been able to create new
jobs. People come up with new things to do.”
    Still, Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is
something different about today’s digital
technologies—something that could affect an even
broader range of work. The question, he says, is
whether economic history will serve as a useful
guide. Will the job disruptions caused by technology
be temporary as the workforce adapts, or will we see
a science-fiction scenario in which automated
processes and robots with superhuman skills take
over a broad swath of human tasks? Though Katz
expects the historical pattern to hold, it is “genuinely
a question,” he says. “If technology disrupts enough,
who knows what will happen?”

This passage is adapted from Taras Grescoe, Straphanger:
Saving Our Cities and Ourselves from the Automobile. ©2012
by Taras Grescoe.

    Though there are 600 million cars on the planet,
and counting, there are also seven billion people,
which means that for the vast majority of us getting
around involves taking buses, ferryboats, commuter
trains, streetcars, and subways. In other words,
traveling to work, school, or the market means being
a straphanger: somebody who, by choice or necessity,
relies on public transport, rather than a privately
owned automobile.
    Half the population of New York, Toronto, and
London do not own cars. Public transport is how
most of the people of Asia and Africa, the world’s
most populous continents, travel. Every day, subway
systems carry 155 million passengers, thirty-four
times the number carried by all the world’s airplanes,
and the global public transport market is now valued
at $428 billion annually. A century and a half after
the invention of the internal combustion engine,
private car ownership is still an anomaly.
    And yet public transportation, in many minds, is
the opposite of glamour—a squalid last resort for
those with one too many impaired driving charges,
too poor to afford insurance, or too decrepit to get
behind the wheel of a car. In much of North
America, they are right: taking transit is a depressing
experience. Anybody who has waited far too long on
a street corner for the privilege of boarding a
lurching, overcrowded bus, or wrestled luggage onto
subways and shuttles to get to a big city airport,
knows that transit on this continent tends to be
underfunded, ill-maintained, and ill-planned. Given
the opportunity, who wouldn’t drive? Hopping in a
car almost always gets you to your destination more
quickly.
    It doesn’t have to be like this. Done right, public
transport can be faster, more comfortable, and
cheaper than the private automobile. In Shanghai,
German-made magnetic levitation trains skim over
elevated tracks at 266 miles an hour, whisking people
to the airport at a third of the speed of sound. In
provincial French towns, electric-powered streetcars
run silently on rubber tires, sliding through narrow
streets along a single guide rail set into cobblestones.
From Spain to Sweden, Wi-Fi equipped high-speed
trains seamlessly connect with highly ramified metro
networks, allowing commuters to work on laptops as
they prepare for same-day meetings in once distant
capital cities. In Latin America, China, and India,
working people board fast-loading buses that move
like subway trains along dedicated busways, leaving
the sedans and SUVs of the rich mired in
dawn-to-dusk traffic jams. And some cities have
transformed their streets into cycle-path freeways,
making giant strides in public health and safety and
the sheer livability of their neighborhoods—in the
process turning the workaday bicycle into a viable
form of mass transit.
    If you credit the demographers, this transit trend
has legs. The “Millenials,” who reached adulthood
around the turn of the century and now outnumber
baby boomers, tend to favor cities over suburbs, and
are far more willing than their parents to ride buses
and subways. Part of the reason is their ease with
iPads, MP3 players, Kindles, and smartphones: you
can get some serious texting done when you’re not
driving, and earbuds offer effective insulation from
all but the most extreme commuting annoyances.
Even though there are more teenagers in the country
than ever, only ten million have a driver’s license
(versus twelve million a generation ago). Baby
boomers may have been raised in Leave It to Beaver
suburbs, but as they retire, a significant contingent is
favoring older cities and compact towns where they
have the option of walking and riding bikes. Seniors,
too, are more likely to use transit, and by 2025, there
will be 64 million Americans over the age of
sixty-five. Already, dwellings in older neighborhoods
in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Denver, especially
those near light-rail or subway stations, are
commanding enormous price premiums over
suburban homes. The experience of European and
Asian cities shows that if you make buses, subways,
and trains convenient, comfortable, fast, and safe, a
surprisingly large percentage of citizens will opt to
ride rather than drive.

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

It can reasonably be inferred that “the strong-minded” (line 32) was a term generally intended to
A) praise women who fight for their long-denied rights.
B) identify women who demonstrate intellectual skill.
C) criticize women who enter male-dominated professions.

This passage is adapted from Iain King, “Can Economics Be
Ethical?” ©2013 by Prospect Publishing.

    Recent debates about the economy have
rediscovered the question, “is that right?”, where
“right” means more than just profits or efficiency.
Some argue that because the free markets allow
for personal choice, they are already ethical. Others
have accepted the ethical critique and embraced
corporate social responsibility. But before we can
label any market outcome as “immoral,” or sneer at
economists who try to put a price on being ethical,
we need to be clear on what we are talking about.
    There are different views on where ethics should
apply when someone makes an economic decision.
Consider Adam Smith, widely regarded as the
founder of modern economics. He was a moral
philosopher who believed sympathy for others was
the basis for ethics (we would call it empathy
nowadays). But one of his key insights in The Wealth
of Nations was that acting on this empathy could be
counter-productive—he observed people becoming
better off when they put their own empathy aside,
and interacted in a self-interested way. Smith justifies
selfish behavior by the outcome. Whenever planners
use cost-benefit analysis to justify a new railway line,
or someone retrains to boost his or her earning
power, or a shopper buys one to get one free, they are
using the same approach: empathizing with
someone, and seeking an outcome that makes that
person as well off as possible—although the person
they are empathizing with may be themselves in the
future.
   Instead of judging consequences, Aristotle
said ethics was about having the right
character—displaying virtues like courage and
honesty. It is a view put into practice whenever
business leaders are chosen for their good character.
But it is a hard philosophy to teach—just how much
loyalty should you show to a manufacturer that keeps
losing money? Show too little and you’re a “greed is
good” corporate raider; too much and you’re wasting
money on unproductive capital. Aristotle thought
there was a golden mean between the two extremes,
and finding it was a matter of fine judgment. But if
ethics is about character, it’s not clear what those
characteristics should be.
    There is yet another approach: instead of rooting
ethics in character or the consequences of actions, we
can focus on our actions themselves. From this
perspective some things are right, some wrong—we
should buy fair trade goods, we shouldn’t tell lies in
advertisements. Ethics becomes a list of
commandments, a catalog of “dos” and “don’ts.”
When a finance official refuses to devalue a currency
because they have promised not to, they are defining
ethics this way. According to this approach
devaluation can still be bad, even if it would make
everybody better off.
    Many moral dilemmas arise when these three
versions pull in different directions but clashes are
not inevitable. Take fair trade coffee (coffee that is
sold with a certification that indicates the farmers
and workers who produced it were paid a fair wage),
for example: buying it might have good
consequences, be virtuous, and also be the right way
to act in a flawed market. Common ground like this
suggests that, even without agreement on where
ethics applies, ethical economics is still possible.
    Whenever we feel queasy about “perfect”
competitive markets, the problem is often rooted in a
phony conception of people. The model of man on
which classical economics is based—an entirely
rational and selfish being—is a parody, as
John Stuart Mill, the philosopher who pioneered the
model, accepted. Most people—even economists—
now accept that this “economic man” is a fiction.
We behave like a herd; we fear losses more than we
hope for gains; rarely can our brains process all the
relevant facts.
    These human quirks mean we can never make
purely “rational” decisions. A new wave of behavioral
economists, aided by neuroscientists, is trying to
understand our psychology, both alone and in
groups, so they can anticipate our decisions in the
marketplace more accurately. But psychology can
also help us understand why we react in disgust at
economic injustice, or accept a moral law as
universal. Which means that the relatively new
science of human behavior might also define ethics
for us. Ethical economics would then emerge from
one of the least likely places: economists themselves.

This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is
Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,
but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the
doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The
poor market may be slowing innovation, but
advances continue; judging by the mood this week at
the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in
Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
    The technology that’s surprised almost everyone
is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,
silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and
Martin Green, professor at the University of
New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar
panel researchers, declared that they’d never go
below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like
50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per
watt,” he says.
    The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of
reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar
panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020.
Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target
even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the
direct cost of solar power to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost
expected for power from new natural gas power
plants.
    All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have
been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the
power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady
cost reductions. Green points to something as
mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of
the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar
cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon
solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To
achieve that record, he had to use expensive
lithography techniques to make fine wires for
collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual
improvements have made it possible to use screen
printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research
suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce
lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of
the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at
costs far lower than his lithography techniques.
    Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a
new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,
which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar
cell they made is the only current challenger to
silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film
cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower
the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power
cheaper.
    One of Green’s former students and colleagues,
Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer
China Sunergy, announced this week that he is
building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided
solar cell that can absorb light from both the front
and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that
during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the
land between rows of solar panels in a solar power
plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels
and could be harvested to increase the power output.
This works particularly well when the solar panels
are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a
one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a
two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He
expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more
electricity over the course of a year.
    Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,
aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in
cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to
greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels
by combining silicon with one or two other
semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a
part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert
efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost
efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to
around 40 percent. Adding another could make
efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which
would cut in half the number of solar panels needed
for a given installation. The challenge is to produce
good connections between these semiconductors,
something made challenging by the arrangement of
silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

This passage is adapted from Mary Helen Stefaniak, The
Cailiffs of Baghdad, Georgia: A Novel. ©2010 by Mary Helen
Stefaniak.

    Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”

fictional Swedish scientist, has set out for the North Pole
in a hydrogen-powered balloon.

    My emotions are complicated and not
readily verifiable. I feel a vast yearning that is
simultaneously a pleasure and a pain. I am certain
of the consummation of this yearning, but I don’t
know yet what form it will take, since I do not
understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.
For the first time there is borne in upon me the full
truth of what I myself said to the doctor only an hour
ago: that my motives in this undertaking are not
entirely clear. For years, for a lifetime, the machinery
of my destiny has worked in secret to prepare for this
moment; its clockwork has moved exactly toward
this time and place and no other. Rising slowly from
the earth that bore me and gave me sustenance, I am
carried helplessly toward an uninhabited and hostile,
or at best indifferent, part of the earth, littered with
the bones of explorers and the wrecks of ships, frozen
supply caches, messages scrawled with chilled fingers
and hidden in cairns that no eye will ever see.
Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have
died. Yet in freely willing this enterprise, in choosing
this moment and no other when the south wind
will carry me exactly northward at a velocity of
eight knots, I have converted the machinery of my
fate into the servant of my will. All this I understand,
as I understand each detail of the technique by which
this is carried out. What I don’t understand is why I
am so intent on going to this particular place. Who
wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat
it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like
a railway? The Danish ministers have declared from
their pulpits that participation in polar expeditions is
beneficial to the soul’s eternal well-being, or so I read
in a newspaper. It isn’t clear how this doctrine is to
be interpreted, except that the Pole is something
difficult or impossible to attain which must
nevertheless be sought for, because man is
condemned to seek out and know everything
whether or not the knowledge gives him pleasure. In
short, it is the same unthinking lust for knowledge
that drove our First Parents out of the garden.
    And suppose you were to find it in spite of all, this
wonderful place that everybody is so anxious to stand
on! What would you find? Exactly nothing.
A point precisely identical to all the others in a
completely featureless wasteland stretching around it
for hundreds of miles. It is an abstraction, a
mathematical fiction. No one but a Swedish madman
could take the slightest interest in it. Here I am. The
wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily
northward at the speed of a trotting dog. Behind us,
perhaps forever, lie the Cities of Men with their
teacups and their brass bedsteads. I am going forth of
my own volition to join the ghosts of Bering and
poor Franklin, of frozen De Long and his men.
What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not
an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself. The
doctor was right, even though I dislike him.
Fundamentally I am a dangerous madman, and what
I do is both a challenge to my egotism and a
surrender to it.

A) perished in the attempt.

This passage is adapted from David Owen, The Conundrum:
How Scientific Innovation, Increased Efficiency, and Good
Intentions Can Make Our Energy and Climate Problems Worse.
©2011 by David Owen.

    Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
Line prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
    One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control
measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
    Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
    One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.

qThis passage is adapted from Carolyn Gramling, “Source of
Mysterious Medieval Eruption Identified.” ©2013 by
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

    About 750 years ago, a powerful volcano erupted
somewhere on Earth, kicking off a centuries-long
cold snap known as the Little Ice Age. Identifying the
volcano responsible has been tricky.
    That a powerful volcano erupted somewhere in
the world, sometime in the Middle Ages, is written in
polar ice cores in the form of layers of sulfate
deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass. These
cores suggest that the amount of sulfur the mystery
volcano sent into the stratosphere put it firmly
among the ranks of the strongest climate-perturbing
eruptions of the current geological epoch, the
Holocene, a period that stretches from 10,000 years
ago to the present. A haze of stratospheric sulfur
cools the climate by reflecting solar energy back into
space.
    In 2012, a team of scientists led by geochemist
Gifford Miller strengthened the link between the
mystery eruption and the onset of the Little Ice Age
by using radiocarbon dating of dead plant material
from beneath the ice caps on Baffin Island and
Iceland, as well as ice and sediment core data, to
determine that the cold summers and ice growth
began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 C.E. (and
became intensified between 1430 and 1455 C.E.).
Such a sudden onset pointed to a huge volcanic
eruption injecting sulfur into the stratosphere and
starting the cooling. Subsequent, unusually large and
frequent eruptions of other volcanoes, as well as
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks persisting long after the
aerosols have been removed from the atmosphere,
may have prolonged the cooling through the 1700s.
    Volcanologist Franck Lavigne and colleagues now
think they’ve identified the volcano in question:
Indonesia’s Samalas. One line of evidence, they note,
is historical records. According to Babad Lombok,
records of the island written on palm leaves in Old
Javanese, Samalas erupted catastrophically before the
end of the 13th century, devastating surrounding
villages—including Lombok’s capital at the time,
Pamatan—with ash and fast-moving sweeps of hot
rock and gas called pyroclastic flows.
    The researchers then began to reconstruct the
formation of the large, 800-meter-deep caldera [a
basin-shaped volcanic crater] that now sits atop the
volcano. They examined 130 outcrops on the flanks
of the volcano, exposing sequences of pumice—ash
hardened into rock—and other pyroclastic material.
The volume of ash deposited, and the estimated
height of the eruption plume (43 kilometers above
sea level) put the eruption’s magnitude at a
minimum of 7 on the volcanic explosivity index
(which has a scale of 1 to 8)—making it one of the
largest known in the Holocene.
    The team also performed radiocarbon analyses on
carbonized tree trunks and branches buried within
the pyroclastic deposits to confirm the date of the
eruption; it could not, they concluded, have
happened before 1257 C.E., and certainly happened
in the 13th century.
    It’s not a total surprise that an Indonesian volcano
might be the source of the eruption, Miller says. “An
equatorial eruption is more consistent with the
apparent climate impacts.” And, he adds, with sulfate
appearing in both polar ice caps—Arctic and
Antarctic—there is “a strong consensus” that this
also supports an equatorial source.
    Another possible candidate—both in terms of
timing and geographical location—is Ecuador’s
Quilotoa, estimated to have last erupted between
1147 and 1320 C.E. But when Lavigne’s team
examined shards of volcanic glass from this volcano,
they found that they didn’t match the chemical
composition of the glass found in polar ice cores,
whereas the Samalas glass is a much closer match.
That, they suggest, further strengthens the case that
Samalas was responsible for the medieval “year
without summer” in 1258 C.E.



Question 46:
Where does the author indicate the medieval volcanic eruption most probably was located?
A) Near the equator, in Indonesia
B) In the Arctic region

This passage is adapted from Alan Ehrenhalt, The Great
Inversion and the Future of the American City. ©2013 by
Vintage. Ehrenhalt is an urbanologist—a scholar of cities
and their development. Demographic inversion is a
phenomenon that describes the rearrangement of living
patterns throughout a metropolitan area.

    We are not witnessing the abandonment of the
suburbs, or a movement of millions of people back to
the city all at once. The 2010 census certainly did not
turn up evidence of a middle-class stampede to the
nation’s cities. The news was mixed: Some of the
larger cities on the East Coast tended to gain
population, albeit in small increments. Those in the
Midwest, including Chicago, tended to lose
substantial numbers. The cities that showed gains in
overall population during the entire decade tended to
be in the South and Southwest. But when it comes to
measuring demographic inversion, raw census
numbers are an ineffective blunt instrument. A closer
look at the results shows that the most powerful
demographic events of the past decade were the
movement of African Americans out of central cities
(180,000 of them in Chicago alone) and the
settlement of immigrant groups in suburbs, often
ones many miles distant from downtown.
Central-city areas that gained affluent residents in
the first part of the decade maintained that
population in the recession years from 2007 to 2009.
They also, according to a 2011 study by Brookings,
suffered considerably less from increased
unemployment than the suburbs did. Not many
young professionals moved to new downtown
condos in the recession years because few such
residences were being built. But there is no reason to
believe that the demographic trends prevailing prior
to the construction bust will not resume once that
bust is over. It is important to remember that
demographic inversion is not a proxy for population
growth; it can occur in cities that are growing, those
whose numbers are flat, and even in those
undergoing a modest decline in size.
    America’s major cities face enormous fiscal
problems, many of them the result of public pension
obligations they incurred in the more prosperous
years of the past two decades. Some, Chicago
prominent among them, simply are not producing
enough revenue to support the level of public
services to which most of the citizens have grown to
feel entitled. How the cities are going to solve this
problem, I do not know. What I do know is that if
fiscal crisis were going to drive affluent professionals
out of central cities, it would have done so by now.
There is no evidence that it has.
    The truth is that we are living at a moment in
which the massive outward migration of the affluent
that characterized the second half of the
twentieth century is coming to an end. And we need
to adjust our perceptions of cities, suburbs, and
urban mobility as a result.
    Much of our perspective on the process of
metropolitan settlement dates, whether we realize it
or not, from a paper written in 1925 by the
University of Chicago sociologist Ernest W. Burgess.
It was Burgess who defined four urban/suburban
zones of settlement: a central business district; an
area of manufacturing just beyond it; then a
residential area inhabited by the industrial and
immigrant working class; and finally an outer
enclave of single-family dwellings.
    Burgess was right about the urban America of
1925; he was right about the urban America of 1974.
Virtually every city in the country had a downtown,
where the commercial life of the metropolis was
conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had
districts of working-class residences just beyond that;
and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the
upper middle class at the far end of the continuum.
As a family moved up the economic ladder, it also
moved outward from crowded working-class
districts to more spacious apartments and,
eventually, to a suburban home. The suburbs of
Burgess’s time bore little resemblance to those at the
end of the twentieth century, but the theory still
essentially worked. People moved ahead in life by
moving farther out.
    But in the past decade, in quite a few places, this
model has ceased to describe reality. There are still
downtown commercial districts, but there are no
factory districts lying next to them. There are
scarcely any factories at all. These close-in parts of
the city, whose few residents Burgess described as
dwelling in “submerged regions of poverty,
degradation and disease,” are increasingly the
preserve of the affluent who work in the commercial
core. And just as crucially newcomers to America are
not settling on the inside and accumulating the
resources to move out; they are living in the suburbs
from day one.

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.



Question 26:
Which conclusion is best supported by the findings of Olausson’s 1993 experiment?
A) Stimulation at bodily extremities can be sensed as rapidly as stimulation closer to the brain.
B) The presence of hairs in human skin lessens the speed with which nerves conduct signals.
C) Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.
D) The speed at which a nerve fires is dependent on the strength of pressure applied to the nerve.

Passage 1
    The mental consequences of our online
info-crunching are not universally bad.
Certain cognitive skills are strengthened by our use
of computers and the Net. These tend to involve
more primitive mental functions, such as hand-eye
coordination, reflex response, and the processing of
visual cues. One much-cited study of video gaming
revealed that after just 10 days of playing action
games on computers, a group of young people had
significantly boosted the speed with which they could
shift their visual focus between various images and
tasks.
     It’s likely that Web browsing also strengthens
brain functions related to fast-paced problem
solving, particularly when it requires spotting
patterns in a welter of data. A British study of the
way women search for medical information online
indicated that an experienced Internet user can, at
least in some cases, assess the trustworthiness and
probable value of a Web page in a matter of seconds.
The more we practice surfing and scanning, the more
adept our brain becomes at those tasks.
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly
at such benefits and conclude that the Web is making
us smarter. In a Science article published in early
2009, prominent developmental psychologist Patricia
Greenfield reviewed more than 40 studies of the
effects of various types of media on intelligence and
learning ability. She concluded that “every medium
develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.

This passage is adapted from Daniel Chamovitz, What a
Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses. ©2012 by
Daniel Chamovitz

    The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
    We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.



Question 50:
Based on the passage, what potential criticism might be made of Volkov’s testing of Hodick and Sievers’s model?
A) Volkov’s understanding of Hodick and Sievers’s model was incorrect.
B) Volkov’s measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers’s model.
C) Volkov’s direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
D) Volkov’s technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.

Passage 1 is adapted from Edmund Burke, Reflections on the
Revolution in France. Originally published in 1790. Passage 2
is adapted from Thomas Paine, Rights of Man. Originally
published in 1791.

Passage 1
    To avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and
versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of
obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have
consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions but with due
caution; that he should never dream of beginning its
reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of
a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By
this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him
into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their
poisonous weeds, and wild incantations, they may
regenerate the paternal constitution, and renovate
their father’s life.
    Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts
for objects of mere occasional interest may be
dissolved at pleasure—but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or
tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken
up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved
by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with
other reverence; because it is not a partnership in
things subservient only to the gross animal existence
of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a
partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
only between those who are living, but between those
who are living, those who are dead, and those who
are to be born. . . . The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at
their pleasure, and on their speculations of a
contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear
asunder the bands of their subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos of elementary principles.

Passage 2
    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is
the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who
are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each
other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagination
can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can
exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid
down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence,
and the other not in, and who never can meet in this
world, that the one should control the other to the
end of time?...
    The circumstances of the world are continually
changing, and the opinions of men change also; and
as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in
one age, may be thought wrong and found
inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to
decide, the living, or the dead?

A) brevity and prominence.

Passage 1 is adapted from Michael Slezak, “Space Mining:
the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.



Question 47:
The central claim of Passage 2 is that space mining has positive potential but
A) it will end up encouraging humanity’s reckless treatment of the environment.
B) its effects should be thoughtfully considered before it becomes a reality.
C) such potential may not include replenishing key resources that are disappearing on Earth.
D) experts disagree about the commercial viability of the discoveries it could yield.

This passage is adapted from Bryan Walsh, “Whole Food
Blues: Why Organic Agriculture May Not Be So Sustainable.”
©2012 by Time Inc.

    When it comes to energy, everyone loves
efficiency. Cutting energy waste is one of those goals
that both sides of the political divide can agree on,
even if they sometimes diverge on how best to get
there. Energy efficiency allows us to get more out of
our given resources, which is good for the economy
and (mostly) good for the environment as well. In
an increasingly hot and crowded world, the only
sustainable way to live is to get more out of less.
Every environmentalist would agree.
    But change the conversation to food, and
suddenly efficiency doesn’t look so good.
Conventional industrial agriculture has become
incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis.
Thanks to fertilizers, mechanization and irrigation,
each American farmer feeds over 155 people
worldwide. Conventional farming gets more and
more crop per square foot of cultivated land—
over 170 bushels of corn per acre in Iowa, for
example—which can mean less territory needs to
be converted from wilderness to farmland.
And since a third of the planet is already used for
agriculture—destroying forests and other wild
habitats along the way—anything that could help us
produce more food on less land would seem to be
good for the environment.
    Of course, that’s not how most environmentalists
regard their arugula [a leafy green]. They have
embraced organic food as better for the planet—and
healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by
agricultural corporations. Environmentalists disdain
the enormous amounts of energy needed and waste
created by conventional farming, while organic
practices—forgoing artificial fertilizers and chemical
pesticides—are considered far more sustainable.
Sales of organic food rose 7.7% in 2010, up to $26.7
billion—and people are making those purchases for
their consciences as much as their taste buds.
    Yet a new meta-analysis in Nature does the math
and comes to a hard conclusion: organic farming
yields 25% fewer crops on average than conventional
agriculture. More land is therefore needed to
produce fewer crops—and that means organic
farming may not be as good for the planet as
we think.
    In the Nature analysis, scientists from McGill
University in Montreal and the University of
Minnesota performed an analysis of 66 studies
comparing conventional and organic methods across
34 different crop species, from fruits to grains to
legumes. They found that organic farming delivered
a lower yield for every crop type, though the disparity
varied widely. For rain-watered legume crops like
beans or perennial crops like fruit trees, organic
trailed conventional agriculture by just 5%. Yet for
major cereal crops like corn or wheat, as well as most
vegetables—all of which provide the bulk of the
world’s calories—conventional agriculture
outperformed organics by more than 25%.
    The main difference is nitrogen, the chemical key
to plant growth. Conventional agriculture makes use
of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each
year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant
growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the
compost or cover crops used in organic farming.
When we talk about a Green Revolution, we really
mean a nitrogen revolution—along with a lot
of water.
    But not all the nitrogen used in conventional
fertilizer ends up in crops—much of it ends up
running off the soil and into the oceans, creating vast
polluted dead zones. We’re already putting more
nitrogen into the soil than the planet can stand over
the long term. And conventional agriculture also
depends heavily on chemical pesticides, which can
have unintended side effects.
    What that means is that while conventional
agriculture is more efficient—sometimes much more
efficient—than organic farming, there are trade-offs
with each. So an ideal global agriculture system, in
the views of the study’s authors, may borrow the best
from both systems, as Jonathan Foley of the
University of Minnesota explained:
   The bottom line? Today’s organic farming
   practices are probably best deployed in fruit and
   vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not
   just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for
   delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple
   crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on,
   conventional farms have the advantage right
   now.
   Looking forward, I think we will need to deploy
   different kinds of practices (especially new,
   mixed approaches that take the best of organic
   and conventional farming systems) where they
   are best suited—geographically, economically,
   socially, etc.




Question 26:
Which statement best expresses a relationship between organic farming and conventional farming that is presented in the passage?
A) Both are equally sustainable, but they differ dramatically in the amount of land they require to produce equivalent yields.
B) Both rely on artificial chemicals for pest control, but organic farmers use the chemicals sparingly in conjunction with natural remedies.
C) Both use nitrogen to encourage plant growth, but the nitrogen used in conventional farming comes from synthetic sources.
D) Both create a substantial amount of nitrogen runoff, but only the type of nitrogen found in fertilizers used in conventional farming can be dangerous.

develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.

This passage is adapted from Marlene Zuk, Paleofantasy:
What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We
Live. ©2013 by Marlene Zuk.

    A female guppy can be sexually mature at two
months of age and have her first babies just a month
later. This unstinting rate of reproduction makes
Line guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of
evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC
Riverside, has been doing exactly that for the last few
decades.
    People usually think of guppies as colorful
aquarium fish, but they also have a life in the real
world, inhabiting streams and rivers in tropical
places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his
fieldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of
conditions depending on the luck of the draw.
A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of
rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike
cichlids found in calmer downstream waters. As you
might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the
proportion of individuals that die—is much higher in
the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those
without them.
    Reznick has shown that if you bring the fish into
the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from
the sites with many predators become sexually
mature when they are younger and smaller than do
the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition,
the litters of baby guppies produced by mothers from
the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual
baby is smaller than those produced by their
counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if
you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have
babies sooner, and spreading your energy reserves
over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will
manage to pass on some of your genes before you
meet your fate. Reznick and other scientists also
demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the
guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which they
grow up.
    How quickly, though, could these differences in
how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have
evolved? Because there are numerous tributaries of
the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some
but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as
he put it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test
tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places
they had not originally occurred, and then watch as
natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called
“experimental evolution,” and it is growing
increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for
humans to be able to see the outcome within our
lifetimes.
    Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick
removed groups of guppies from their predator
ridden lives below the waterfall and released them
into previously guppy-free streams above the falls.
Although small predatory killifish occurred in these
new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the
danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for
nature to do its work, and they brought the
descendants of the transplanted fish back to the lab
to examine their reproduction. After just eleven
years, the guppies released in the new streams had
evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger
offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that
naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams.
Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown
evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years,
or a little over four generations, with more time
required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability
to form schools and less time for changes in the
colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.



Question 24:
In lines 43-44, Reznick uses the phrase “giant test tubes” to suggest that certain streams can
A) provide suitable experimental conditions.
B) promote cooperative behaviors in specimens.
C) expedite the rate of genetic changes.
D) solve widespread environmental problems.

This passage is adapted from Daniel Chamovitz, What a
Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses. ©2012 by
Daniel Chamovitz

    The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
    We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.

The primary purpose of the passage is to

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.
Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the
only way in which capacities can be proved,—by
trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best
faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere
beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that
whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of
mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those
faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only
in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the
qualities which are not permitted to be exercised
shall not exist.



Question 39:
Tocqueville in Passage 1 would most likely characterize the position taken by Mill in lines 65-69 in Passage 2 (“Let... them”) as
A) less radical about gender roles than it might initially seem.
B) persuasive in the abstract but difficult to implement in practice.
C) ill-advised but consistent with a view held by some other advocates of gender equality.
D) compatible with economic progress in the United States but not in Europe.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Passage 1 is adapted from Michael Slezak, “Space Mining:
the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.

This passage is adapted from Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle
S. Adams, ""Money Can't Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs about
Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation."" ©2008 by Elsevier
Inc.

    Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
full force—both online and on foot—searching
frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
that their purchases will disappoint rather than
delight the intended recipients.
    Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
social process, serving various political, religious, and
psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
not very good at predicting what gifts others will
appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
psychologists. Research has found that people often
struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
projection, and multiple attribution errors.
    What is surprising is that gift-givers have
considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and
gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend
each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.
In the present research, we propose a unique
psychological explanation for this overspending
problem—i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they
spend with how much recipients will appreciate the
gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a
gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation). Although a
link between gift price and feelings of appreciation
might seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an
assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose
that gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their
feelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift
than givers assume.
    Why do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely
linked to gift-recipients’ feelings of appreciation?
Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more
expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of
thoughtfulness and consideration. According to
Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a
symbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal
their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future
relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be
motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to
send a “stronger signal” to their intended recipient.
As for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller
and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger
signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.
    The notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being
unable to account for the other party’s perspective
seems puzzling because people slip in and out of
these roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple
times in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the
extensive experience that people have as both givers
and receivers, they often struggle to transfer
information gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)
and apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as
a receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize
information about their own preferences and
experiences in order to produce more efficient
outcomes in their exchange relations. In practical
terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on
gifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift
expenditures according to personal insight.

the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.

Passage 1 is adapted from a speech delivered in 1898 by
Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is
adapted from a speech delivered in 1900 by William
Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.

What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We
Live. ©2013 by Marlene Zuk.

    A female guppy can be sexually mature at two
months of age and have her first babies just a month
later. This unstinting rate of reproduction makes
Line guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of
evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC
Riverside, has been doing exactly that for the last few
decades.
    People usually think of guppies as colorful
aquarium fish, but they also have a life in the real
world, inhabiting streams and rivers in tropical
places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his
fieldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of
conditions depending on the luck of the draw.
A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of
rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike
cichlids found in calmer downstream waters. As you
might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the
proportion of individuals that die—is much higher in
the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those
without them.
    Reznick has shown that if you bring the fish into
the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from
the sites with many predators become sexually
mature when they are younger and smaller than do
the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition,
the litters of baby guppies produced by mothers from
the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual
baby is smaller than those produced by their
counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if
you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have
babies sooner, and spreading your energy reserves
over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will
manage to pass on some of your genes before you
meet your fate. Reznick and other scientists also
demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the
guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which they
grow up.
    How quickly, though, could these differences in
how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have
evolved? Because there are numerous tributaries of
the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some
but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as
he put it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test
tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places
they had not originally occurred, and then watch as
natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called
“experimental evolution,” and it is growing
increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for
humans to be able to see the outcome within our
lifetimes.
    Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick
removed groups of guppies from their predator
ridden lives below the waterfall and released them
into previously guppy-free streams above the falls.
Although small predatory killifish occurred in these
new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the
danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for
nature to do its work, and they brought the
descendants of the transplanted fish back to the lab
to examine their reproduction. After just eleven
years, the guppies released in the new streams had
evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger
offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that
naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams.
Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown
evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years,
or a little over four generations, with more time
required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability
to form schools and less time for changes in the
colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.

This passage is adapted from Mary Helen Stefaniak, The
Cailiffs of Baghdad, Georgia: A Novel. ©2010 by Mary Helen
Stefaniak.

    Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”



Question 7:
In the third paragraph, what is the narrator most likely suggesting by describing Miss Spivey as having “wandered” (line 40) in one situation and “marched” (line 49) in another situation?
A) Dewey, knowing Miss Spivey wasn’t very confident in her ability to teach, instilled in her a sense of determination.
B) Talking with Dewey over coffee made Miss Spivey realize how excited she was to teach in the poorest, most remote corner of America.
C) After two years spent studying, Miss Spivey was anxious to start teaching and be in charge of her own classroom.
D) Miss Spivey’s initial encounter with Dewey’s ideas was somewhat accidental but ultimately motivated her to decisive action.

This passage is adapted from Amy Tan, The Bonesetter’s
Daughter. ©2001 by Amy Tan.

    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.

This passage is adapted from Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle
S. Adams, ""Money Can't Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs about
Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation."" ©2008 by Elsevier
Inc.

    Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
full force—both online and on foot—searching
frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
that their purchases will disappoint rather than
delight the intended recipients.
    Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
social process, serving various political, religious, and
psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
not very good at predicting what gifts others will
appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
psychologists. Research has found that people often
struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
projection, and multiple attribution errors.
    What is surprising is that gift-givers have
considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and
gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend
each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.
In the present research, we propose a unique
psychological explanation for this overspending
problem—i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they
spend with how much recipients will appreciate the
gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a
gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation). Although a
link between gift price and feelings of appreciation
might seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an
assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose
that gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their
feelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift
than givers assume.
    Why do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely
linked to gift-recipients’ feelings of appreciation?
Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more
expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of
thoughtfulness and consideration. According to
Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a
symbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal
their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future
relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be
motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to
send a “stronger signal” to their intended recipient.
As for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller
and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger
signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.
    The notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being
unable to account for the other party’s perspective
seems puzzling because people slip in and out of
these roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple
times in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the
extensive experience that people have as both givers
and receivers, they often struggle to transfer
information gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)
and apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as
a receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize
information about their own preferences and
experiences in order to produce more efficient
outcomes in their exchange relations. In practical
terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on
gifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift
expenditures according to personal insight.

The authors most likely use the examples in lines 1-9 of the passage (“Every... showers”) to highlight the

Passage 1 is adapted from Michael Slezak, “Space Mining:
the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.

What function does the discussion of water in lines 35-40 serve in Passage 1?
A) It continues an extended comparison that begins in the previous paragraph.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....
    Consider, sir, dispassionately, these
observations—for a glimpse of this truth seemed to
open before you when you observed, “that to see one
half of the human race excluded by the other from all
participation of government, was a political
phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it
was impossible to explain.” If so, on what does your
constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will
bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by
a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same
test: though a different opinion prevails in this
country, built on the very arguments which you use
to justify the oppression of woman—prescription.
    Consider—I address you as a legislator—
whether, when men contend for their freedom, and
to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their
own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to
subjugate women, even though you firmly believe
that you are acting in the manner best calculated to
promote their happiness? Who made man the
exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift
of reason?
    In this style, argue tyrants of every
denomination, from the weak king to the weak
father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason;
yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be
useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force
all women, by denying them civil and political rights,
to remain immured in their families groping in
the dark?

This passage is adapted from Iain King, “Can Economics Be
Ethical?” ©2013 by Prospect Publishing.

    Recent debates about the economy have
rediscovered the question, “is that right?”, where
“right” means more than just profits or efficiency.
Some argue that because the free markets allow
for personal choice, they are already ethical. Others
have accepted the ethical critique and embraced
corporate social responsibility. But before we can
label any market outcome as “immoral,” or sneer at
economists who try to put a price on being ethical,
we need to be clear on what we are talking about.
    There are different views on where ethics should
apply when someone makes an economic decision.
Consider Adam Smith, widely regarded as the
founder of modern economics. He was a moral
philosopher who believed sympathy for others was
the basis for ethics (we would call it empathy
nowadays). But one of his key insights in The Wealth
of Nations was that acting on this empathy could be
counter-productive—he observed people becoming
better off when they put their own empathy aside,
and interacted in a self-interested way. Smith justifies
selfish behavior by the outcome. Whenever planners
use cost-benefit analysis to justify a new railway line,
or someone retrains to boost his or her earning
power, or a shopper buys one to get one free, they are
using the same approach: empathizing with
someone, and seeking an outcome that makes that
person as well off as possible—although the person
they are empathizing with may be themselves in the
future.
   Instead of judging consequences, Aristotle
said ethics was about having the right
character—displaying virtues like courage and
honesty. It is a view put into practice whenever
business leaders are chosen for their good character.
But it is a hard philosophy to teach—just how much
loyalty should you show to a manufacturer that keeps
losing money? Show too little and you’re a “greed is
good” corporate raider; too much and you’re wasting
money on unproductive capital. Aristotle thought
there was a golden mean between the two extremes,
and finding it was a matter of fine judgment. But if
ethics is about character, it’s not clear what those
characteristics should be.
    There is yet another approach: instead of rooting
ethics in character or the consequences of actions, we
can focus on our actions themselves. From this
perspective some things are right, some wrong—we
should buy fair trade goods, we shouldn’t tell lies in
advertisements. Ethics becomes a list of
commandments, a catalog of “dos” and “don’ts.”
When a finance official refuses to devalue a currency
because they have promised not to, they are defining
ethics this way. According to this approach
devaluation can still be bad, even if it would make
everybody better off.
    Many moral dilemmas arise when these three
versions pull in different directions but clashes are
not inevitable. Take fair trade coffee (coffee that is
sold with a certification that indicates the farmers
and workers who produced it were paid a fair wage),
for example: buying it might have good
consequences, be virtuous, and also be the right way
to act in a flawed market. Common ground like this
suggests that, even without agreement on where
ethics applies, ethical economics is still possible.
    Whenever we feel queasy about “perfect”
competitive markets, the problem is often rooted in a
phony conception of people. The model of man on
which classical economics is based—an entirely
rational and selfish being—is a parody, as
John Stuart Mill, the philosopher who pioneered the
model, accepted. Most people—even economists—
now accept that this “economic man” is a fiction.
We behave like a herd; we fear losses more than we
hope for gains; rarely can our brains process all the
relevant facts.
    These human quirks mean we can never make
purely “rational” decisions. A new wave of behavioral
economists, aided by neuroscientists, is trying to
understand our psychology, both alone and in
groups, so they can anticipate our decisions in the
marketplace more accurately. But psychology can
also help us understand why we react in disgust at
economic injustice, or accept a moral law as
universal. Which means that the relatively new
science of human behavior might also define ethics
for us. Ethical economics would then emerge from
one of the least likely places: economists themselves.



Question 11:
The main purpose of the passage is to
A) consider an ethical dilemma posed by cost-benefit analysis.
B) describe a psychology study of ethical economic behavior.
C) argue that the free market prohibits ethical economics.
D) examine ways of evaluating the ethics of economics.

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.



Question 22:
Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected which condition to result from the blocking of fast fibers?
A) The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase.
B) The test subject would perceive gentle stimuli as painful.
C) The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
D) The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.

This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is
Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,
but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the
doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The
poor market may be slowing innovation, but
advances continue; judging by the mood this week at
the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in
Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
    The technology that’s surprised almost everyone
is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,
silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and
Martin Green, professor at the University of
New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar
panel researchers, declared that they’d never go
below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like
50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per
watt,” he says.
    The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of
reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar
panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020.
Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target
even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the
direct cost of solar power to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost
expected for power from new natural gas power
plants.
    All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have
been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the
power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady
cost reductions. Green points to something as
mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of
the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar
cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon
solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To
achieve that record, he had to use expensive
lithography techniques to make fine wires for
collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual
improvements have made it possible to use screen
printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research
suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce
lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of
the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at
costs far lower than his lithography techniques.
    Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a
new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,
which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar
cell they made is the only current challenger to
silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film
cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower
the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power
cheaper.
    One of Green’s former students and colleagues,
Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer
China Sunergy, announced this week that he is
building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided
solar cell that can absorb light from both the front
and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that
during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the
land between rows of solar panels in a solar power
plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels
and could be harvested to increase the power output.
This works particularly well when the solar panels
are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a
one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a
two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He
expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more
electricity over the course of a year.
    Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,
aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in
cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to
greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels
by combining silicon with one or two other
semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a
part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert
efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost
efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to
around 40 percent. Adding another could make
efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which
would cut in half the number of solar panels needed
for a given installation. The challenge is to produce
good connections between these semiconductors,
something made challenging by the arrangement of
silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.



Question 47:
According to the passage, two-sided solar panels will likely raise efficiency by
A) requiring little energy to operate.
B) absorbing reflected light.
C) being reasonably inexpensive to manufacture.
D) preventing light from reaching the ground.

Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is

Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.

This passage is adapted from Bryan Walsh, “Whole Food
Blues: Why Organic Agriculture May Not Be So Sustainable.”
©2012 by Time Inc.

    When it comes to energy, everyone loves
efficiency. Cutting energy waste is one of those goals
that both sides of the political divide can agree on,
even if they sometimes diverge on how best to get
there. Energy efficiency allows us to get more out of
our given resources, which is good for the economy
and (mostly) good for the environment as well. In
an increasingly hot and crowded world, the only
sustainable way to live is to get more out of less.
Every environmentalist would agree.
    But change the conversation to food, and
suddenly efficiency doesn’t look so good.
Conventional industrial agriculture has become
incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis.
Thanks to fertilizers, mechanization and irrigation,
each American farmer feeds over 155 people
worldwide. Conventional farming gets more and
more crop per square foot of cultivated land—
over 170 bushels of corn per acre in Iowa, for
example—which can mean less territory needs to
be converted from wilderness to farmland.
And since a third of the planet is already used for
agriculture—destroying forests and other wild
habitats along the way—anything that could help us
produce more food on less land would seem to be
good for the environment.
    Of course, that’s not how most environmentalists
regard their arugula [a leafy green]. They have
embraced organic food as better for the planet—and
healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by
agricultural corporations. Environmentalists disdain
the enormous amounts of energy needed and waste
created by conventional farming, while organic
practices—forgoing artificial fertilizers and chemical
pesticides—are considered far more sustainable.
Sales of organic food rose 7.7% in 2010, up to $26.7
billion—and people are making those purchases for
their consciences as much as their taste buds.
    Yet a new meta-analysis in Nature does the math
and comes to a hard conclusion: organic farming
yields 25% fewer crops on average than conventional
agriculture. More land is therefore needed to
produce fewer crops—and that means organic
farming may not be as good for the planet as
we think.
    In the Nature analysis, scientists from McGill
University in Montreal and the University of
Minnesota performed an analysis of 66 studies
comparing conventional and organic methods across
34 different crop species, from fruits to grains to
legumes. They found that organic farming delivered
a lower yield for every crop type, though the disparity
varied widely. For rain-watered legume crops like
beans or perennial crops like fruit trees, organic
trailed conventional agriculture by just 5%. Yet for
major cereal crops like corn or wheat, as well as most
vegetables—all of which provide the bulk of the
world’s calories—conventional agriculture
outperformed organics by more than 25%.
    The main difference is nitrogen, the chemical key
to plant growth. Conventional agriculture makes use
of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each
year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant
growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the
compost or cover crops used in organic farming.
When we talk about a Green Revolution, we really
mean a nitrogen revolution—along with a lot
of water.
    But not all the nitrogen used in conventional
fertilizer ends up in crops—much of it ends up
running off the soil and into the oceans, creating vast
polluted dead zones. We’re already putting more
nitrogen into the soil than the planet can stand over
the long term. And conventional agriculture also
depends heavily on chemical pesticides, which can
have unintended side effects.
    What that means is that while conventional
agriculture is more efficient—sometimes much more
efficient—than organic farming, there are trade-offs
with each. So an ideal global agriculture system, in
the views of the study’s authors, may borrow the best
from both systems, as Jonathan Foley of the
University of Minnesota explained:
   The bottom line? Today’s organic farming
   practices are probably best deployed in fruit and
   vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not
   just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for
   delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple
   crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on,
   conventional farms have the advantage right
   now.
   Looking forward, I think we will need to deploy
   different kinds of practices (especially new,
   mixed approaches that take the best of organic
   and conventional farming systems) where they
   are best suited—geographically, economically,
   socially, etc.




Question 28:
According to Foley, an “ideal global agriculture system” (line 80)
A) focuses primarily on yield percentages and global markets.
B) considers multiple factors in the selection of farming techniques.
C) weighs the economic interests of farmers against the needs of consumers.
D) puts the nutritional value of produce first and foremost.

honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong....
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.

Over the course of the passage, the primary focus shifts from
A) Lymie’s inner thoughts to observations made by the other characters.

This passage is adapted from J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick,
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid.” ©1953 by Nature Publishing Group. Watson and Crick
deduced the structure of DNA using evidence from Rosalind
Franklin and R. G. Gosling’s X-ray crystallography diagrams
of DNA and from Erwin Chargaff’s data on the base
composition of DNA.

    The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a
very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a
regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.
To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which
can be of four different types. Two of the possible
bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the
other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.
So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the
chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of
phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.
    The first feature of our structure which is of
biological interest is that it consists not of one chain,
but of two. These two chains are both coiled around
a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that
since there was only one chain in the chemical
formula there would only be one in the structural
unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray
evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.
    The other biologically important feature is the
manner in which the two chains are held together.
This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases.
The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base
from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single
base from the other. The important point is that only
certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.
One member of a pair must be a purine and the other
a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two
chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for
example, there would not be room for it.
    We believe that the bases will be present almost
entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true,
the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are:
adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine.
Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but
when it does, its partner on the other chain must
always be thymine.
    The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is
completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of
bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a
long molecule many different permutations are
possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise
sequence of bases is the code which carries the
genetical information. If the actual order of the bases
on one of the pair of chains were given, one could
write down the exact order of the bases on the other
one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain
is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule might duplicate itself.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

This passage is adapted from David Rotman, “How
Technology Is Destroying Jobs.” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    MIT business scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee have argued that impressive
advances in computer technology—from improved
industrial robotics to automated translation
services—are largely behind the sluggish
employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
more ominous for workers, they foresee dismal
prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful
new technologies are increasingly adopted not only
in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in
professions such as law, financial services, education,
and medicine.
    That robots, automation, and software can replace
people might seem obvious to anyone who’s worked
in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But
Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s claim is more troubling
and controversial. They believe that rapid
technological change has been destroying jobs faster
than it is creating them, contributing to the
stagnation of median income and the growth of
inequality in the United States. And, they suspect,
something similar is happening in other
technologically advanced countries.
    As evidence, Brynjolfsson and McAfee point to a
chart that only an economist could love. In
economics, productivity—the amount of economic
value created for a given unit of input, such as an
hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and
wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the
chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines
represent productivity and total employment in the
United States. For years after World War II, the
two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in
jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The
pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value
from their workers, the country as a whole became
richer, which fueled more economic activity and
created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the
lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,
but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a
significant gap appears between the two lines,
showing economic growth with no parallel increase
in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the
“great decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is
confident that technology is behind both the healthy
growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.
    It’s a startling assertion because it threatens the
faith that many economists place in technological
progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that
technology boosts productivity and makes societies
wealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark
side: technological progress is eliminating the need
for many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker
worse off than before. Brynjolfsson can point to a
second chart indicating that median income is failing
to rise even as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s
the great paradox of our era,” he says. “Productivity
is at record levels, innovation has never been faster,
and yet at the same time, we have a falling median
income and we have fewer jobs. People are falling
behind because technology is advancing so fast and
our skills and organizations aren’t keeping up.”
    While technological changes can be painful for
workers whose skills no longer match the needs of
employers, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist,
says that no historical pattern shows these shifts
leading to a net decrease in jobs over an extended
period. Katz has done extensive research on how
technological advances have affected jobs over the
last few centuries—describing, for example, how
highly skilled artisans in the mid-19th century were
displaced by lower-skilled workers in factories.
While it can take decades for workers to acquire the
expertise needed for new types of employment, he
says, “we never have run out of jobs. There is no
long-term trend of eliminating work for people. Over
the long term, employment rates are fairly
stable. People have always been able to create new
jobs. People come up with new things to do.”
    Still, Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is
something different about today’s digital
technologies—something that could affect an even
broader range of work. The question, he says, is
whether economic history will serve as a useful
guide. Will the job disruptions caused by technology
be temporary as the workforce adapts, or will we see
a science-fiction scenario in which automated
processes and robots with superhuman skills take
over a broad swath of human tasks? Though Katz
expects the historical pattern to hold, it is “genuinely
a question,” he says. “If technology disrupts enough,
who knows what will happen?”



Question 16:
Which of the following best characterizes Katz’s attitude toward “today’s digital technologies” (lines 81-82)?
A) He is alarmed about countries’ increasing reliance on them.
B) He is unconcerned about their effect on the economy.
C) He is uncertain how they might affect job growth.
D) He is optimistic that they will spur job creation to a degree not seen since the mid-nineteenth century.

Passage 1 is adapted from Edmund Burke, Reflections on the
Revolution in France. Originally published in 1790. Passage 2
is adapted from Thomas Paine, Rights of Man. Originally
published in 1791.

Passage 1
    To avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and
versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of
obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have
consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions but with due
caution; that he should never dream of beginning its
reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of
a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By
this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him
into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their
poisonous weeds, and wild incantations, they may
regenerate the paternal constitution, and renovate
their father’s life.
    Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts
for objects of mere occasional interest may be
dissolved at pleasure—but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or
tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken
up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved
by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with
other reverence; because it is not a partnership in
things subservient only to the gross animal existence
of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a
partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
only between those who are living, but between those
who are living, those who are dead, and those who
are to be born. . . . The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at
their pleasure, and on their speculations of a
contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear
asunder the bands of their subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos of elementary principles.

Passage 2
    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is
the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who
are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each
other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagination
can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can
exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid
down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence,
and the other not in, and who never can meet in this
world, that the one should control the other to the
end of time?...
    The circumstances of the world are continually
changing, and the opinions of men change also; and
as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in
one age, may be thought wrong and found
inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to
decide, the living, or the dead?

This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is
Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,
but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the
doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The
poor market may be slowing innovation, but
advances continue; judging by the mood this week at
the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in
Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
    The technology that’s surprised almost everyone
is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,
silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and
Martin Green, professor at the University of
New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar
panel researchers, declared that they’d never go
below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like
50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per
watt,” he says.
    The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of
reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar
panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020.
Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target
even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the
direct cost of solar power to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost
expected for power from new natural gas power
plants.
    All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have
been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the
power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady
cost reductions. Green points to something as
mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of
the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar
cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon
solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To
achieve that record, he had to use expensive
lithography techniques to make fine wires for
collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual
improvements have made it possible to use screen
printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research
suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce
lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of
the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at
costs far lower than his lithography techniques.
    Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a
new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,
which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar
cell they made is the only current challenger to
silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film
cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower
the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power
cheaper.
    One of Green’s former students and colleagues,
Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer
China Sunergy, announced this week that he is
building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided
solar cell that can absorb light from both the front
and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that
during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the
land between rows of solar panels in a solar power
plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels
and could be harvested to increase the power output.
This works particularly well when the solar panels
are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a
one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a
two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He
expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more
electricity over the course of a year.
    Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,
aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in
cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to
greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels
by combining silicon with one or two other
semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a
part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert
efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost
efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to
around 40 percent. Adding another could make
efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which
would cut in half the number of solar panels needed
for a given installation. The challenge is to produce
good connections between these semiconductors,
something made challenging by the arrangement of
silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

This passage is adapted from Taras Grescoe, Straphanger:
Saving Our Cities and Ourselves from the Automobile. ©2012
by Taras Grescoe.

    Though there are 600 million cars on the planet,
and counting, there are also seven billion people,
which means that for the vast majority of us getting
around involves taking buses, ferryboats, commuter
trains, streetcars, and subways. In other words,
traveling to work, school, or the market means being
a straphanger: somebody who, by choice or necessity,
relies on public transport, rather than a privately
owned automobile.
    Half the population of New York, Toronto, and
London do not own cars. Public transport is how
most of the people of Asia and Africa, the world’s
most populous continents, travel. Every day, subway
systems carry 155 million passengers, thirty-four
times the number carried by all the world’s airplanes,
and the global public transport market is now valued
at $428 billion annually. A century and a half after
the invention of the internal combustion engine,
private car ownership is still an anomaly.
    And yet public transportation, in many minds, is
the opposite of glamour—a squalid last resort for
those with one too many impaired driving charges,
too poor to afford insurance, or too decrepit to get
behind the wheel of a car. In much of North
America, they are right: taking transit is a depressing
experience. Anybody who has waited far too long on
a street corner for the privilege of boarding a
lurching, overcrowded bus, or wrestled luggage onto
subways and shuttles to get to a big city airport,
knows that transit on this continent tends to be
underfunded, ill-maintained, and ill-planned. Given
the opportunity, who wouldn’t drive? Hopping in a
car almost always gets you to your destination more
quickly.
    It doesn’t have to be like this. Done right, public
transport can be faster, more comfortable, and
cheaper than the private automobile. In Shanghai,
German-made magnetic levitation trains skim over
elevated tracks at 266 miles an hour, whisking people
to the airport at a third of the speed of sound. In
provincial French towns, electric-powered streetcars
run silently on rubber tires, sliding through narrow
streets along a single guide rail set into cobblestones.
From Spain to Sweden, Wi-Fi equipped high-speed
trains seamlessly connect with highly ramified metro
networks, allowing commuters to work on laptops as
they prepare for same-day meetings in once distant
capital cities. In Latin America, China, and India,
working people board fast-loading buses that move
like subway trains along dedicated busways, leaving
the sedans and SUVs of the rich mired in
dawn-to-dusk traffic jams. And some cities have
transformed their streets into cycle-path freeways,
making giant strides in public health and safety and
the sheer livability of their neighborhoods—in the
process turning the workaday bicycle into a viable
form of mass transit.
    If you credit the demographers, this transit trend
has legs. The “Millenials,” who reached adulthood
around the turn of the century and now outnumber
baby boomers, tend to favor cities over suburbs, and
are far more willing than their parents to ride buses
and subways. Part of the reason is their ease with
iPads, MP3 players, Kindles, and smartphones: you
can get some serious texting done when you’re not
driving, and earbuds offer effective insulation from
all but the most extreme commuting annoyances.
Even though there are more teenagers in the country
than ever, only ten million have a driver’s license
(versus twelve million a generation ago). Baby
boomers may have been raised in Leave It to Beaver
suburbs, but as they retire, a significant contingent is
favoring older cities and compact towns where they
have the option of walking and riding bikes. Seniors,
too, are more likely to use transit, and by 2025, there
will be 64 million Americans over the age of
sixty-five. Already, dwellings in older neighborhoods
in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Denver, especially
those near light-rail or subway stations, are
commanding enormous price premiums over
suburban homes. The experience of European and
Asian cities shows that if you make buses, subways,
and trains convenient, comfortable, fast, and safe, a
surprisingly large percentage of citizens will opt to
ride rather than drive.

This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of
Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the
House of Fuji, a noble family.

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were
tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”
    “Yes?”
    “I mean to have him.”

Passage 1 is adapted from Abraham Lincoln, “Address to the
Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.” Originally
delivered in 1838. Passage 2 is from Henry David Thoreau,
“Resistance to Civil Government.” Originally published
in 1849.

Passage 1
    Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong....
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled
with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left
to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify
the protein. Et voilà—human medicine! And, for
GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006,
becoming the world’s first transgenic animal drug.
Over the course of a year, the “milking parlors” on
GTC’s 300-acre farm in Massachusetts can collect
more than a kilogram of medicine from a single
animal.

This passage is adapted from Alan Ehrenhalt, The Great
Inversion and the Future of the American City. ©2013 by
Vintage. Ehrenhalt is an urbanologist—a scholar of cities
and their development. Demographic inversion is a
phenomenon that describes the rearrangement of living
patterns throughout a metropolitan area.

    We are not witnessing the abandonment of the
suburbs, or a movement of millions of people back to
the city all at once. The 2010 census certainly did not
turn up evidence of a middle-class stampede to the
nation’s cities. The news was mixed: Some of the
larger cities on the East Coast tended to gain
population, albeit in small increments. Those in the
Midwest, including Chicago, tended to lose
substantial numbers. The cities that showed gains in
overall population during the entire decade tended to
be in the South and Southwest. But when it comes to
measuring demographic inversion, raw census
numbers are an ineffective blunt instrument. A closer
look at the results shows that the most powerful
demographic events of the past decade were the
movement of African Americans out of central cities
(180,000 of them in Chicago alone) and the
settlement of immigrant groups in suburbs, often
ones many miles distant from downtown.
Central-city areas that gained affluent residents in
the first part of the decade maintained that
population in the recession years from 2007 to 2009.
They also, according to a 2011 study by Brookings,
suffered considerably less from increased
unemployment than the suburbs did. Not many
young professionals moved to new downtown
condos in the recession years because few such
residences were being built. But there is no reason to
believe that the demographic trends prevailing prior
to the construction bust will not resume once that
bust is over. It is important to remember that
demographic inversion is not a proxy for population
growth; it can occur in cities that are growing, those
whose numbers are flat, and even in those
undergoing a modest decline in size.
    America’s major cities face enormous fiscal
problems, many of them the result of public pension
obligations they incurred in the more prosperous
years of the past two decades. Some, Chicago
prominent among them, simply are not producing
enough revenue to support the level of public
services to which most of the citizens have grown to
feel entitled. How the cities are going to solve this
problem, I do not know. What I do know is that if
fiscal crisis were going to drive affluent professionals
out of central cities, it would have done so by now.
There is no evidence that it has.
    The truth is that we are living at a moment in
which the massive outward migration of the affluent
that characterized the second half of the
twentieth century is coming to an end. And we need
to adjust our perceptions of cities, suburbs, and
urban mobility as a result.
    Much of our perspective on the process of
metropolitan settlement dates, whether we realize it
or not, from a paper written in 1925 by the
University of Chicago sociologist Ernest W. Burgess.
It was Burgess who defined four urban/suburban
zones of settlement: a central business district; an
area of manufacturing just beyond it; then a
residential area inhabited by the industrial and
immigrant working class; and finally an outer
enclave of single-family dwellings.
    Burgess was right about the urban America of
1925; he was right about the urban America of 1974.
Virtually every city in the country had a downtown,
where the commercial life of the metropolis was
conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had
districts of working-class residences just beyond that;
and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the
upper middle class at the far end of the continuum.
As a family moved up the economic ladder, it also
moved outward from crowded working-class
districts to more spacious apartments and,
eventually, to a suburban home. The suburbs of
Burgess’s time bore little resemblance to those at the
end of the twentieth century, but the theory still
essentially worked. People moved ahead in life by
moving farther out.
    But in the past decade, in quite a few places, this
model has ceased to describe reality. There are still
downtown commercial districts, but there are no
factory districts lying next to them. There are
scarcely any factories at all. These close-in parts of
the city, whose few residents Burgess described as
dwelling in “submerged regions of poverty,
degradation and disease,” are increasingly the
preserve of the affluent who work in the commercial
core. And just as crucially newcomers to America are
not settling on the inside and accumulating the
resources to move out; they are living in the suburbs
from day one.

This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of
Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the
House of Fuji, a noble family.

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were
tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”
    “Yes?”
    “I mean to have him.”

This passage is adapted from “How the Web Affects
Memory.” ©2011 by Harvard Magazine Inc.


    Search engines have changed the way we use the
Internet, putting vast sources of information just a
few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology
Line Daniel Wegner’s recent research proves that
websites—and the Internet—are changing much
more than technology itself. They are changing the
way our memories function.
    Wegner’s latest study, “Google Effects on
Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having
Information at Our Fingertips,” shows that when
people have access to search engines, they remember
fewer facts and less information because they know
they can rely on “search” as a readily available
shortcut.
    Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes
the new findings show that the Internet has become
part of a transactive memory source, a method by
which our brains compartmentalize information.
First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive
memory exists in many forms, as when a husband
relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.
“[It is] this whole network of memory where you
don’t have to remember everything in the world
yourself,” he says. “You just have to remember who
knows it.” Now computers and technology as well
are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.
    The idea validates habits already forming in our
daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary
location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars
remove the need to memorize directions.
Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our
memories too far to remember the name of an
obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan—we
just type our questions into Google. “We become
part of the Internet in a way,” he says. “We become
part of the system and we end up trusting it.”
    Working with researchers Betsy Sparrow of
Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University
of Wisconsin–Madison, Wegner conducted four
experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using
various forms of memory recall to test reliance on
computers. In the first experiment, participants
demonstrated that they were more likely to think of
computer terms like “Yahoo” or “Google” after being
asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other
experiments, participants were asked to type a
collection of readily memorable statements, such as
“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” Half the
subjects were told that their work would be saved to a
computer; the other half were informed that the
statements would be erased. In subsequent memory
testing, participants who were told their work would
not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In
a fourth experiment, participants typed into a
computer statements they were told would be saved
in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the
statements. Finally, they were given cues to the
wording and asked to name the folders where the
statements were stored. The participants proved
better able to recall the folder locations than the
statements themselves.
    Wegner concedes that questions remain about
whether dependence on computers will affect
memories negatively: “Nobody knows now what the
effects are of these tools on logical thinking.”
Students who have trouble remembering distinct
facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts
in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation
overall is beneficial, likening dependence on
computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or
other prosthetic device.
    And even though we may not be taxing our
memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using
them to consider where the facts are located and how
to access them. “We still have to remember things,”
Wegner explains. “We’re just remembering a
different range of things.” He believes his study will
lead to further research into understanding computer
dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent
of human interdependence with the computer
world—pinpointing the “movable dividing line
between us and our computers in cyber networks.”

Which choice best supports the idea that reliance on computers does not necessarily diminish human memory?
A) Lines 3-6 (“But Harvard... itself”)

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

This passage is adapted from Amy Tan, The Bonesetter’s
Daughter. ©2001 by Amy Tan.

    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.



Question 7:
Based on the artistic philosophy expressed in the fourth paragraph (lines 46-59), it is reasonable to infer that Precious Auntie would consider a hastily written first draft of a story to be
A) emotionally raw and powerful.
B) creatively satisfying for the author.
C) essentially worthless in and of itself.

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the

This passage is adapted from MacDonald Harris,
The Balloonist. ©2011 by The Estate of Donald Heiney.
During the summer of 1897, the narrator of this story, a
fictional Swedish scientist, has set out for the North Pole
in a hydrogen-powered balloon.

    My emotions are complicated and not
readily verifiable. I feel a vast yearning that is
simultaneously a pleasure and a pain. I am certain
of the consummation of this yearning, but I don’t
know yet what form it will take, since I do not
understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.
For the first time there is borne in upon me the full
truth of what I myself said to the doctor only an hour
ago: that my motives in this undertaking are not
entirely clear. For years, for a lifetime, the machinery
of my destiny has worked in secret to prepare for this
moment; its clockwork has moved exactly toward
this time and place and no other. Rising slowly from
the earth that bore me and gave me sustenance, I am
carried helplessly toward an uninhabited and hostile,
or at best indifferent, part of the earth, littered with
the bones of explorers and the wrecks of ships, frozen
supply caches, messages scrawled with chilled fingers
and hidden in cairns that no eye will ever see.
Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have
died. Yet in freely willing this enterprise, in choosing
this moment and no other when the south wind
will carry me exactly northward at a velocity of
eight knots, I have converted the machinery of my
fate into the servant of my will. All this I understand,
as I understand each detail of the technique by which
this is carried out. What I don’t understand is why I
am so intent on going to this particular place. Who
wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat
it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like
a railway? The Danish ministers have declared from
their pulpits that participation in polar expeditions is
beneficial to the soul’s eternal well-being, or so I read
in a newspaper. It isn’t clear how this doctrine is to
be interpreted, except that the Pole is something
difficult or impossible to attain which must
nevertheless be sought for, because man is
condemned to seek out and know everything
whether or not the knowledge gives him pleasure. In
short, it is the same unthinking lust for knowledge
that drove our First Parents out of the garden.
    And suppose you were to find it in spite of all, this
wonderful place that everybody is so anxious to stand
on! What would you find? Exactly nothing.
A point precisely identical to all the others in a
completely featureless wasteland stretching around it
for hundreds of miles. It is an abstraction, a
mathematical fiction. No one but a Swedish madman
could take the slightest interest in it. Here I am. The
wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily
northward at the speed of a trotting dog. Behind us,
perhaps forever, lie the Cities of Men with their
teacups and their brass bedsteads. I am going forth of
my own volition to join the ghosts of Bering and
poor Franklin, of frozen De Long and his men.
What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not
an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself. The
doctor was right, even though I dislike him.
Fundamentally I am a dangerous madman, and what
I do is both a challenge to my egotism and a
surrender to it.



Question 1:
Over the course of the passage, the narrator’s attitude shifts from
A) fear about the expedition to excitement about it.
B) doubt about his abilities to confidence in them.
C) uncertainty of his motives to recognition of them.
D) disdain for the North Pole to appreciation of it.

This passage is adapted from Virginia Woolf, Three Guineas.
©1938 by Harcourt, Inc. Here, Woolf considers the situation
of women in English society.

    Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames,
an admirable vantage ground for us to make a
survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden
with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other,
Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a
place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not
now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession—the procession of the sons of educated
men.
    There they go, our brothers who have been
educated at public schools and universities,
mounting those steps, passing in and out of those
doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine,
transacting business, making money. It is a solemn
sight always—a procession, like a caravanserai
crossing a desert. . . . But now, for the past twenty
years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a
photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of
time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic
appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that
makes a difference. We who have looked so long at
the pageant in books, or from a curtained window
watched educated men leaving the house at about
nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house
at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively
no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount
those steps, pass in and out of those doors,... make
money, administer justice. . . . We who now agitate
these humble pens may in another century or two
speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine
spirit—a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say
whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in
military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old
family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that
venerable object was never decorated with plumes of
white horsehair. You laugh—indeed the shadow of
the private house still makes those dresses look a
little queer. We have worn private clothes so
long. . . . But we have not come here to laugh, or to
talk of fashions—men’s and women’s. We are here,
on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions.
And they are very important questions; and we have
very little time in which to answer them. The
questions that we have to ask and to answer about
that procession during this moment of transition are
so important that they may well change the lives of
all men and women for ever. For we have to ask
ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don’t we? On what terms shall we join
that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the
procession of educated men? The moment is short; it
may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a
matter of a few months longer.... But, you will
object, you have no time to think; you have your
battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to
organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam.
As you know from your own experience, and there
are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men
have always done their thinking from hand to
mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought
while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the
cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our
brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on
thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think
we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while
we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations
and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think . . . in the
gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts;
let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals.
Let us never cease from thinking—what is this
“civilization” in which we find ourselves? What are
these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why
should we make money out of them? Where in
short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of
educated men?



Question 38:
Woolf characterizes the questions in lines 53-57 (“For we... men”) as both
A) controversial and threatening.
B) weighty and unanswerable.
C) momentous and pressing.
D) provocative and mysterious.

This passage is adapted from Daniyal Mueenuddin,
“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
    The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
    “What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”
    “Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
    “And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
    The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
    The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.



Question 4:
Which choice best supports the claim that Nawab performs his duties for Harouni well?

This passage is adapted from Taras Grescoe, Straphanger:
Saving Our Cities and Ourselves from the Automobile. ©2012
by Taras Grescoe.

    Though there are 600 million cars on the planet,
and counting, there are also seven billion people,
which means that for the vast majority of us getting
around involves taking buses, ferryboats, commuter
trains, streetcars, and subways. In other words,
traveling to work, school, or the market means being
a straphanger: somebody who, by choice or necessity,
relies on public transport, rather than a privately
owned automobile.
    Half the population of New York, Toronto, and
London do not own cars. Public transport is how
most of the people of Asia and Africa, the world’s
most populous continents, travel. Every day, subway
systems carry 155 million passengers, thirty-four
times the number carried by all the world’s airplanes,
and the global public transport market is now valued
at $428 billion annually. A century and a half after
the invention of the internal combustion engine,
private car ownership is still an anomaly.
    And yet public transportation, in many minds, is
the opposite of glamour—a squalid last resort for
those with one too many impaired driving charges,
too poor to afford insurance, or too decrepit to get
behind the wheel of a car. In much of North
America, they are right: taking transit is a depressing
experience. Anybody who has waited far too long on
a street corner for the privilege of boarding a
lurching, overcrowded bus, or wrestled luggage onto
subways and shuttles to get to a big city airport,
knows that transit on this continent tends to be
underfunded, ill-maintained, and ill-planned. Given
the opportunity, who wouldn’t drive? Hopping in a
car almost always gets you to your destination more
quickly.
    It doesn’t have to be like this. Done right, public
transport can be faster, more comfortable, and
cheaper than the private automobile. In Shanghai,
German-made magnetic levitation trains skim over
elevated tracks at 266 miles an hour, whisking people
to the airport at a third of the speed of sound. In
provincial French towns, electric-powered streetcars
run silently on rubber tires, sliding through narrow
streets along a single guide rail set into cobblestones.
From Spain to Sweden, Wi-Fi equipped high-speed
trains seamlessly connect with highly ramified metro
networks, allowing commuters to work on laptops as
they prepare for same-day meetings in once distant
capital cities. In Latin America, China, and India,
working people board fast-loading buses that move
like subway trains along dedicated busways, leaving
the sedans and SUVs of the rich mired in
dawn-to-dusk traffic jams. And some cities have
transformed their streets into cycle-path freeways,
making giant strides in public health and safety and
the sheer livability of their neighborhoods—in the
process turning the workaday bicycle into a viable
form of mass transit.
    If you credit the demographers, this transit trend
has legs. The “Millenials,” who reached adulthood
around the turn of the century and now outnumber
baby boomers, tend to favor cities over suburbs, and
are far more willing than their parents to ride buses
and subways. Part of the reason is their ease with
iPads, MP3 players, Kindles, and smartphones: you
can get some serious texting done when you’re not
driving, and earbuds offer effective insulation from
all but the most extreme commuting annoyances.
Even though there are more teenagers in the country
than ever, only ten million have a driver’s license
(versus twelve million a generation ago). Baby
boomers may have been raised in Leave It to Beaver
suburbs, but as they retire, a significant contingent is
favoring older cities and compact towns where they
have the option of walking and riding bikes. Seniors,
too, are more likely to use transit, and by 2025, there
will be 64 million Americans over the age of
sixty-five. Already, dwellings in older neighborhoods
in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Denver, especially
those near light-rail or subway stations, are
commanding enormous price premiums over
suburban homes. The experience of European and
Asian cities shows that if you make buses, subways,
and trains convenient, comfortable, fast, and safe, a
surprisingly large percentage of citizens will opt to
ride rather than drive.

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.



Question 48:
In the last sentence of Passage 2, the author uses the phrase “five years and £500 million” primarily to
A) emphasize the scale of the effort needed to make teixobactin available for consumer use.
B) criticize the level of funding that the government has committed to teixobactin development.
C) underscore the amount of time and money that has already been spent researching teixobactin.
D) compare the amount of money spent developing teixobactin with the amount spent developing other antibiotics.

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually

    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.



Question 7:
What function does the second paragraph (lines 30-52) serve in the passage as a whole?
A) It presents the particular moment at which Silas realized that Eppie was changing him.
B) It highlights Silas’s love for Eppie by depicting the sacrifices that he makes for her.
C) It illustrates the effect that Eppie has on Silas by describing the interaction between them.
D) It reveals a significant alteration in the relationship between Silas and Eppie.

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.



Question 51:
Information in Passage 2 best supports which conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1?
A) Exposure to teixobactin made them less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.
B) Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections.
C) Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
D) Teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.

This passage is from Lydia Minatoya, The Strangeness of
Beauty. ©1999 by Lydia Minatoya. The setting is Japan in
1920. Chie and her daughter Naomi are members of the
House of Fuji, a noble family.

    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were
tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”
    “Yes?”
    “I mean to have him.”



Question 9:
Why does Akira say his meeting with Chie is “a matter of urgency” (line 32)?
A) He fears that his own parents will disapprove of Naomi.
B) He worries that Naomi will reject him and marry someone else.
C) He has been offered an attractive job in another country.
D) He knows that Chie is unaware of his feelings for Naomi.

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is
adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....
    Consider, sir, dispassionately, these
observations—for a glimpse of this truth seemed to
open before you when you observed, “that to see one
half of the human race excluded by the other from all
participation of government, was a political
phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it
was impossible to explain.” If so, on what does your
constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will
bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by
a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same
test: though a different opinion prevails in this
country, built on the very arguments which you use
to justify the oppression of woman—prescription.
    Consider—I address you as a legislator—
whether, when men contend for their freedom, and
to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their
own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to
subjugate women, even though you firmly believe
that you are acting in the manner best calculated to
promote their happiness? Who made man the
exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift
of reason?
    In this style, argue tyrants of every
denomination, from the weak king to the weak
father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason;
yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be
useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force
all women, by denying them civil and political rights,
to remain immured in their families groping in
the dark?



Question 41:
How would the authors of Passage 1 most likely respond to the points made in the final paragraph of Passage 2?
A) Women are not naturally suited for the exercise of civil and political rights.
B) Men and women possess similar degrees of reasoning ability.
C) Women do not need to remain confined to their traditional family duties.
D) The principles of natural law should not be invoked when considering gender roles.

This passage is adapted from Mary Helen Stefaniak, The
Cailiffs of Baghdad, Georgia: A Novel. ©2010 by Mary Helen
Stefaniak.

    Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”



Question 3:
It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that some of the people at the train station regard Miss Spivey’s comment about the Georgia heat with
A) sympathy, because they assume that she is experiencing intense heat for the first time.
B) disappointment, because they doubt that she will stay in Threestep for very long.
C) embarrassment, because they imagine that she is superior to them.
D) resentment, because they feel that she is minimizing their discomfort.

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.
Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the
only way in which capacities can be proved,—by
trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best
faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere
beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that
whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of
mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those
faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only
in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the
qualities which are not permitted to be exercised
shall not exist.



Question 38:
Both authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles that they describe would be
A) part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.

This passage is adapted from Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle
S. Adams, ""Money Can't Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs about
Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation."" ©2008 by Elsevier
Inc.

    Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
full force—both online and on foot—searching
frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
that their purchases will disappoint rather than
delight the intended recipients.
    Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
social process, serving various political, religious, and
psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
not very good at predicting what gifts others will
appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
psychologists. Research has found that people often
struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
projection, and multiple attribution errors.
    What is surprising is that gift-givers have
considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and
gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend
each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.
In the present research, we propose a unique
psychological explanation for this overspending
problem—i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they
spend with how much recipients will appreciate the
gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a
gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation). Although a
link between gift price and feelings of appreciation
might seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an
assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose
that gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their
feelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift
than givers assume.
    Why do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely
linked to gift-recipients’ feelings of appreciation?
Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more
expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of
thoughtfulness and consideration. According to
Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a
symbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal
their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future
relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be
motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to
send a “stronger signal” to their intended recipient.
As for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller
and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger
signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.
    The notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being
unable to account for the other party’s perspective
seems puzzling because people slip in and out of
these roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple
times in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the
extensive experience that people have as both givers
and receivers, they often struggle to transfer
information gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)
and apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as
a receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize
information about their own preferences and
experiences in order to produce more efficient
outcomes in their exchange relations. In practical
terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on
gifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift
expenditures according to personal insight.

The “social psychologists” mentioned in paragraph 2 (lines 17-34) would likely describe the “deadweight loss” phenomenon as

cleaner? Check out the reviews on online merchant
Amazon. But a new study suggests that such online
scores don’t always reveal the best choice. A massive
controlled experiment of Web users finds that such
ratings are highly susceptible to irrational “herd
behavior”—and that the herd can be manipulated.
Sometimes the crowd really is wiser than you. The
classic examples are guessing the weight of a bull or
the number of gumballs in a jar. Your guess is
probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the
average of many people’s choices is remarkably close
to the true number.
    But what happens when the goal is to judge
something less tangible, such as the quality or worth
of a product? According to one theory, the wisdom
of the crowd still holds—measuring the aggregate of
people’s opinions produces a stable, reliable
value. Skeptics, however, argue that people’s
opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So
nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary
opinions—for example, exposing them to some very
good or very bad attitudes—will steer the crowd in a
different direction. To test which hypothesis is true,
you would need to manipulate huge numbers of
people, exposing them to false information and
determining how it affects their opinions.
    A team led by Sinan Aral, a network scientist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, did exactly that. Aral has been secretly
working with a popular website that aggregates news
stories. The website allows users to make comments
about news stories and vote each other’s comments
up or down. The vote tallies are visible as a number
next to each comment, and the position of the
comments is chronological. (Stories on the site get an
average of about ten comments and about three votes
per comment.) It’s a follow-up to his experiment
using people’s ratings of movies to measure how
much individual people influence each other online
(answer: a lot). This time, he wanted to know how
much the crowd influences the individual, and
whether it can be controlled from outside.
    For five months, every comment submitted by a
user randomly received an “up” vote (positive); a
“down” vote (negative); or as a control, no vote at all.
The team then observed how users rated those
comments. The users generated more than
100,000 comments that were viewed more than
10 million times and rated more than 300,000 times
by other users.
    At least when it comes to comments on news
sites, the crowd is more herdlike than wise.
Comments that received fake positive votes from the
researchers were 32% more likely to receive more
positive votes compared with a control, the team
reports. And those comments were no more likely
than the control to be down-voted by the next viewer
to see them. By the end of the study, positively
manipulated comments got an overall boost of about
25%. However, the same did not hold true for
negative manipulation. The ratings of comments that
got a fake down vote were usually negated by an up
vote by the next user to see them.
    “Our experiment does not reveal the psychology
behind people’s decisions,” Aral says, “but an
intuitive explanation is that people are more
skeptical of negative social influence. They’re more
willing to go along with positive opinions from other
people.”
    Duncan Watts, a network scientist at Microsoft
Research in New York City, agrees with that
conclusion. “[But] one question is whether the
positive [herding] bias is specific to this site” or true
in general, Watts says. He points out that the
category of the news items in the experiment had a
strong effect on how much people could be
manipulated. “I would have thought that ‘business’ is
pretty similar to ‘economics,’ yet they find a much
stronger effect (almost 50% stronger) for the former
than the latter. What explains this difference? If we’re
going to apply these findings in the real world, we’ll
need to know the answers.”
    Will companies be able to boost their products by
manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?
“That is easier said than done,” Watts says. If people
detect—or learn—that comments on a website are
being manipulated, the herd may spook and leave
entirely.

This passage is adapted from Marlene Zuk, Paleofantasy:
What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We
Live. ©2013 by Marlene Zuk.

    A female guppy can be sexually mature at two
months of age and have her first babies just a month
later. This unstinting rate of reproduction makes
Line guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of
evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC
Riverside, has been doing exactly that for the last few
decades.
    People usually think of guppies as colorful
aquarium fish, but they also have a life in the real
world, inhabiting streams and rivers in tropical
places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his
fieldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of
conditions depending on the luck of the draw.
A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of
rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike
cichlids found in calmer downstream waters. As you
might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the
proportion of individuals that die—is much higher in
the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those
without them.
    Reznick has shown that if you bring the fish into
the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from
the sites with many predators become sexually
mature when they are younger and smaller than do
the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition,
the litters of baby guppies produced by mothers from
the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual
baby is smaller than those produced by their
counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if
you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have
babies sooner, and spreading your energy reserves
over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will
manage to pass on some of your genes before you
meet your fate. Reznick and other scientists also
demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the
guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which they
grow up.
    How quickly, though, could these differences in
how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have
evolved? Because there are numerous tributaries of
the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some
but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as
he put it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test
tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places
they had not originally occurred, and then watch as
natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called
“experimental evolution,” and it is growing
increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for
humans to be able to see the outcome within our
lifetimes.
    Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick
removed groups of guppies from their predator
ridden lives below the waterfall and released them
into previously guppy-free streams above the falls.
Although small predatory killifish occurred in these
new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the
danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for
nature to do its work, and they brought the
descendants of the transplanted fish back to the lab
to examine their reproduction. After just eleven
years, the guppies released in the new streams had
evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger
offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that
naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams.
Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown
evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years,
or a little over four generations, with more time
required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability
to form schools and less time for changes in the
colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.



Question 32:
According to the passage, humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when
A) brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals.
B) CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus.
C) nerve fibers that sense pain are suppressed.
D) conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.

This passage is adapted from J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick,
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid.” ©1953 by Nature Publishing Group. Watson and Crick
deduced the structure of DNA using evidence from Rosalind
Franklin and R. G. Gosling’s X-ray crystallography diagrams
of DNA and from Erwin Chargaff’s data on the base
composition of DNA.

    The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a
very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a
regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.
To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which
can be of four different types. Two of the possible
bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the
other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.
So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the
chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of
phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.
    The first feature of our structure which is of
biological interest is that it consists not of one chain,
but of two. These two chains are both coiled around
a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that
since there was only one chain in the chemical
formula there would only be one in the structural
unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray
evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.
    The other biologically important feature is the
manner in which the two chains are held together.
This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases.
The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base
from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single
base from the other. The important point is that only
certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.
One member of a pair must be a purine and the other
a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two
chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for
example, there would not be room for it.
    We believe that the bases will be present almost
entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true,
the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are:
adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine.
Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but
when it does, its partner on the other chain must
always be thymine.
    The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is
completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of
bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a
long molecule many different permutations are
possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise
sequence of bases is the code which carries the
genetical information. If the actual order of the bases
on one of the pair of chains were given, one could
write down the exact order of the bases on the other
one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain
is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule might duplicate itself.

This passage is from Charlotte Brontë, The Professor,
originally published in 1857.

    No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a
mistake in the choice of his profession, and every
man, worthy of the name, will row long against wind
and tide before he allows himself to cry out, “I am
baffled!” and submits to be floated passively back to
land. From the first week of my residence in X—
felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself—the
work of copying and translating business-letters—
was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been
all, I should long have borne with the nuisance; I am
not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the
double desire of getting my living and justifying to
myself and others the resolution I had taken to
become a tradesman, I should have endured in
silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I
should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I
longed for liberty; I should have pent in every sigh by
which my heart might have ventured to intimate its
distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and
joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the
tender and the mighty, should never, either by
softness or strength, have severed me. But this was
not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between
myself and my employer striking deeper root and
spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from
every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to
feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the
slimy walls of a well.
    Antipathy is the only word which can express the
feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in
a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to
be excited by every, the most trifling movement,
look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed
him; the degree of education evinced in my language
irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and
accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high
flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I
too should one day make a successful tradesman.
Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not
have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he
knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he
was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a
ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have
forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three
faculties—Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling
and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never
baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels.
Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it
would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its
slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.
    I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was
returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul
with the pleasant feeling that the master who had
paid me grudged every penny of that hard‑earned
pittance—(I had long ceased to regard
Mr. Crimsworth as my brother—he was a hard,
grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable
tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong,
occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me;
again and again they uttered the same monotonous
phrases. One said: “William, your life is intolerable.”
The other: “What can you do to alter it?” I walked
fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I
approached my lodgings, I turned from a general
view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to
whether my fire would be out; looking towards the
window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red
gleam.

This passage is adapted from Mary Helen Stefaniak, The
Cailiffs of Baghdad, Georgia: A Novel. ©2010 by Mary Helen
Stefaniak.

    Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the

What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete

in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the

shall not exist.

This passage is adapted from Iain King, “Can Economics Be
Ethical?” ©2013 by Prospect Publishing.

    Recent debates about the economy have
rediscovered the question, “is that right?”, where
“right” means more than just profits or efficiency.
Some argue that because the free markets allow
for personal choice, they are already ethical. Others
have accepted the ethical critique and embraced
corporate social responsibility. But before we can
label any market outcome as “immoral,” or sneer at
economists who try to put a price on being ethical,
we need to be clear on what we are talking about.
    There are different views on where ethics should
apply when someone makes an economic decision.
Consider Adam Smith, widely regarded as the
founder of modern economics. He was a moral
philosopher who believed sympathy for others was
the basis for ethics (we would call it empathy
nowadays). But one of his key insights in The Wealth
of Nations was that acting on this empathy could be
counter-productive—he observed people becoming
better off when they put their own empathy aside,
and interacted in a self-interested way. Smith justifies
selfish behavior by the outcome. Whenever planners
use cost-benefit analysis to justify a new railway line,
or someone retrains to boost his or her earning
power, or a shopper buys one to get one free, they are
using the same approach: empathizing with
someone, and seeking an outcome that makes that
person as well off as possible—although the person
they are empathizing with may be themselves in the
future.
   Instead of judging consequences, Aristotle
said ethics was about having the right
character—displaying virtues like courage and
honesty. It is a view put into practice whenever
business leaders are chosen for their good character.
But it is a hard philosophy to teach—just how much
loyalty should you show to a manufacturer that keeps
losing money? Show too little and you’re a “greed is
good” corporate raider; too much and you’re wasting
money on unproductive capital. Aristotle thought
there was a golden mean between the two extremes,
and finding it was a matter of fine judgment. But if
ethics is about character, it’s not clear what those
characteristics should be.
    There is yet another approach: instead of rooting
ethics in character or the consequences of actions, we
can focus on our actions themselves. From this
perspective some things are right, some wrong—we
should buy fair trade goods, we shouldn’t tell lies in
advertisements. Ethics becomes a list of
commandments, a catalog of “dos” and “don’ts.”
When a finance official refuses to devalue a currency
because they have promised not to, they are defining
ethics this way. According to this approach
devaluation can still be bad, even if it would make
everybody better off.
    Many moral dilemmas arise when these three
versions pull in different directions but clashes are
not inevitable. Take fair trade coffee (coffee that is
sold with a certification that indicates the farmers
and workers who produced it were paid a fair wage),
for example: buying it might have good
consequences, be virtuous, and also be the right way
to act in a flawed market. Common ground like this
suggests that, even without agreement on where
ethics applies, ethical economics is still possible.
    Whenever we feel queasy about “perfect”
competitive markets, the problem is often rooted in a
phony conception of people. The model of man on
which classical economics is based—an entirely
rational and selfish being—is a parody, as
John Stuart Mill, the philosopher who pioneered the
model, accepted. Most people—even economists—
now accept that this “economic man” is a fiction.
We behave like a herd; we fear losses more than we
hope for gains; rarely can our brains process all the
relevant facts.
    These human quirks mean we can never make
purely “rational” decisions. A new wave of behavioral
economists, aided by neuroscientists, is trying to
understand our psychology, both alone and in
groups, so they can anticipate our decisions in the
marketplace more accurately. But psychology can
also help us understand why we react in disgust at
economic injustice, or accept a moral law as
universal. Which means that the relatively new
science of human behavior might also define ethics
for us. Ethical economics would then emerge from
one of the least likely places: economists themselves.



Question 12:
In the passage, the author anticipates which of the following objections to criticizing the ethics of free markets?
A) Smith’s association of free markets with ethical behavior still applies today.
B) Free markets are the best way to generate high profits, so ethics are a secondary consideration.
C) Free markets are ethical because they are made possible by devalued currency.
D) Free markets are ethical because they enable individuals to make choices.

This passage is adapted from Marlene Zuk, Paleofantasy:
What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We
Live. ©2013 by Marlene Zuk.

    A female guppy can be sexually mature at two
months of age and have her first babies just a month
later. This unstinting rate of reproduction makes
Line guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of
evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC
Riverside, has been doing exactly that for the last few
decades.
    People usually think of guppies as colorful
aquarium fish, but they also have a life in the real
world, inhabiting streams and rivers in tropical
places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his
fieldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of
conditions depending on the luck of the draw.
A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of
rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike
cichlids found in calmer downstream waters. As you
might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the
proportion of individuals that die—is much higher in
the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those
without them.
    Reznick has shown that if you bring the fish into
the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from
the sites with many predators become sexually
mature when they are younger and smaller than do
the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition,
the litters of baby guppies produced by mothers from
the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual
baby is smaller than those produced by their
counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if
you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have
babies sooner, and spreading your energy reserves
over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will
manage to pass on some of your genes before you
meet your fate. Reznick and other scientists also
demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the
guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which they
grow up.
    How quickly, though, could these differences in
how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have
evolved? Because there are numerous tributaries of
the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some
but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as
he put it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test
tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places
they had not originally occurred, and then watch as
natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called
“experimental evolution,” and it is growing
increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for
humans to be able to see the outcome within our
lifetimes.
    Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick
removed groups of guppies from their predator
ridden lives below the waterfall and released them
into previously guppy-free streams above the falls.
Although small predatory killifish occurred in these
new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the
danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for
nature to do its work, and they brought the
descendants of the transplanted fish back to the lab
to examine their reproduction. After just eleven
years, the guppies released in the new streams had
evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger
offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that
naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams.
Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown
evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years,
or a little over four generations, with more time
required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability
to form schools and less time for changes in the
colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.

This passage is adapted from Geoffrey Giller, “Long a
Mystery, How 500-Meter-High Undersea Waves Form Is
Revealed.” ©2014 by Scientific American.

    Some of the largest ocean waves in the world are
nearly impossible to see. Unlike other large waves,
these rollers, called internal waves, do not ride the
ocean surface. Instead, they move underwater,
undetectable without the use of satellite imagery or
sophisticated monitoring equipment. Despite their
hidden nature, internal waves are fundamental parts
of ocean water dynamics, transferring heat to the
ocean depths and bringing up cold water from below.
And they can reach staggering heights—some as tall
as skyscrapers.
    Because these waves are involved in ocean mixing
and thus the transfer of heat, understanding them is
crucial to global climate modeling, says Tom
Peacock, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Most models fail to take internal
waves into account. “If we want to have more and
more accurate climate models, we have to be able to
capture processes such as this,” Peacock says.
    Peacock and his colleagues tried to do just that.
Their study, published in November in Geophysical
Research Letters, focused on internal waves generated
in the Luzon Strait, which separates Taiwan and the
Philippines. Internal waves in this region, thought to
be some of the largest in the world, can reach about
500 meters high. “That’s the same height as the
Freedom Tower that’s just been built in New York,”
Peacock says.
    Although scientists knew of this phenomenon in
the South China Sea and beyond, they didn’t know
exactly how internal waves formed. To find out,
Peacock and a team of researchers from M.I.T. and
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution worked with
France’s National Center for Scientific Research
using a giant facility there called the Coriolis
Platform. The rotating platform, about 15 meters
(49.2 feet) in diameter, turns at variable speeds and
can simulate Earth’s rotation. It also has walls, which
means scientists can fill it with water and create
accurate, large-scale simulations of various
oceanographic scenarios.
    Peacock and his team built a carbon-fiber resin
scale model of the Luzon Strait, including the islands
and surrounding ocean floor topography. Then they
filled the platform with water of varying salinity to
replicate the different densities found at the strait,
with denser, saltier water below and lighter, less
briny water above. Small particles were added to the
solution and illuminated with lights from below in
order to track how the liquid moved. Finally, they
re-created tides using two large plungers to see how
the internal waves themselves formed.
    The Luzon Strait’s underwater topography, with a
distinct double-ridge shape, turns out to be
responsible for generating the underwater waves.
As the tide rises and falls and water moves through
the strait, colder, denser water is pushed up over the
ridges into warmer, less dense layers above it.
This action results in bumps of colder water trailed
by warmer water that generate an internal wave.
As these waves move toward land, they become
steeper—much the same way waves at the beach
become taller before they hit the shore—until they
break on a continental shelf.
    The researchers were also able to devise a
mathematical model that describes the movement
and formation of these waves. Whereas the model is
specific to the Luzon Strait, it can still help
researchers understand how internal waves are
generated in other places around the world.
Eventually, this information will be incorporated into
global climate models, making them more accurate.
“It’s very clear, within the context of these [global
climate] models, that internal waves play a role in
driving ocean circulations,” Peacock says.



Question 45:
According to Peacock, the ability to monitor internal waves is significant primarily because
A) it will allow scientists to verify the maximum height of such waves.
B) it will allow researchers to shift their focus to improving the quality of satellite images.
C) the study of wave patterns will enable regions to predict and prevent coastal damage.
D) the study of such waves will inform the development of key scientific models.

This passage is adapted from Richard J. Sharpe and Lisa
Heyden, “Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder is Possibly
Caused by a Dietary Pyrethrum Deficiency.” ©2009 by
Elsevier Ltd. Colony collapse disorder is characterized by the
disappearance of adult worker bees from hives.

    Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites).
These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can
kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility
to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Little is known about the natural defenses that keep
the mite infections under control.
    Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which
include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and
related species. These plants produce potent
insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally
occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums.
A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is
pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are
known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite
infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is
treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
    We suspect that the bees of commercial bee
colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally
deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem
is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums,
and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in
such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on
the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are
susceptible to mite infestations which can become
fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of
immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees.
This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or
fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens.
In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally
deficient bees may be further weakened when
commercially produced insecticides are introduced
into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight
mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper
dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be
better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid
pyrethrum containing plants depending on the
amount necessary to defend against mites and the
amount already consumed by the bees, which in
higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.
    This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial
wherein a small number of commercial honey bee
colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum
producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source
such as clover, while controls are offered only the
clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive
with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the
effects of the mite parasites on the experimental
colonies versus control colonies.
    It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee
colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be
some genetic difference between them that affects the
bees’ preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.

This passage is adapted from MacDonald Harris,
The Balloonist. ©2011 by The Estate of Donald Heiney.
During the summer of 1897, the narrator of this story, a
fictional Swedish scientist, has set out for the North Pole
in a hydrogen-powered balloon.

    My emotions are complicated and not
readily verifiable. I feel a vast yearning that is
simultaneously a pleasure and a pain. I am certain
of the consummation of this yearning, but I don’t
know yet what form it will take, since I do not
understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.
For the first time there is borne in upon me the full
truth of what I myself said to the doctor only an hour
ago: that my motives in this undertaking are not
entirely clear. For years, for a lifetime, the machinery
of my destiny has worked in secret to prepare for this
moment; its clockwork has moved exactly toward
this time and place and no other. Rising slowly from
the earth that bore me and gave me sustenance, I am
carried helplessly toward an uninhabited and hostile,
or at best indifferent, part of the earth, littered with
the bones of explorers and the wrecks of ships, frozen
supply caches, messages scrawled with chilled fingers
and hidden in cairns that no eye will ever see.
Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have
died. Yet in freely willing this enterprise, in choosing
this moment and no other when the south wind
will carry me exactly northward at a velocity of
eight knots, I have converted the machinery of my
fate into the servant of my will. All this I understand,
as I understand each detail of the technique by which
this is carried out. What I don’t understand is why I
am so intent on going to this particular place. Who
wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat
it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like
a railway? The Danish ministers have declared from
their pulpits that participation in polar expeditions is
beneficial to the soul’s eternal well-being, or so I read
in a newspaper. It isn’t clear how this doctrine is to
be interpreted, except that the Pole is something
difficult or impossible to attain which must
nevertheless be sought for, because man is
condemned to seek out and know everything
whether or not the knowledge gives him pleasure. In
short, it is the same unthinking lust for knowledge
that drove our First Parents out of the garden.
    And suppose you were to find it in spite of all, this
wonderful place that everybody is so anxious to stand
on! What would you find? Exactly nothing.
A point precisely identical to all the others in a
completely featureless wasteland stretching around it
for hundreds of miles. It is an abstraction, a
mathematical fiction. No one but a Swedish madman
could take the slightest interest in it. Here I am. The
wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily
northward at the speed of a trotting dog. Behind us,
perhaps forever, lie the Cities of Men with their
teacups and their brass bedsteads. I am going forth of
my own volition to join the ghosts of Bering and
poor Franklin, of frozen De Long and his men.
What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not
an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself. The
doctor was right, even though I dislike him.
Fundamentally I am a dangerous madman, and what
I do is both a challenge to my egotism and a
surrender to it.

The question the narrator asks in lines 30-31 (“Will it... railway”) most nearly implies that
A) balloons will never replace other modes of transportation.

of women in English society.

    Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames,
an admirable vantage ground for us to make a
survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden
with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other,
Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a
place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not
now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession—the procession of the sons of educated
men.
    There they go, our brothers who have been
educated at public schools and universities,
mounting those steps, passing in and out of those
doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine,
transacting business, making money. It is a solemn
sight always—a procession, like a caravanserai
crossing a desert. . . . But now, for the past twenty
years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a
photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of
time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic
appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that
makes a difference. We who have looked so long at
the pageant in books, or from a curtained window
watched educated men leaving the house at about
nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house
at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively
no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount
those steps, pass in and out of those doors,... make
money, administer justice. . . . We who now agitate
these humble pens may in another century or two
speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine
spirit—a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say
whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in
military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old
family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that
venerable object was never decorated with plumes of
white horsehair. You laugh—indeed the shadow of
the private house still makes those dresses look a
little queer. We have worn private clothes so
long. . . . But we have not come here to laugh, or to
talk of fashions—men’s and women’s. We are here,
on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions.
And they are very important questions; and we have
very little time in which to answer them. The
questions that we have to ask and to answer about
that procession during this moment of transition are
so important that they may well change the lives of
all men and women for ever. For we have to ask
ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don’t we? On what terms shall we join
that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the
procession of educated men? The moment is short; it
may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a
matter of a few months longer.... But, you will
object, you have no time to think; you have your
battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to
organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam.
As you know from your own experience, and there
are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men
have always done their thinking from hand to
mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought
while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the
cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our
brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on
thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think
we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while
we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations
and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think . . . in the
gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts;
let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals.
Let us never cease from thinking—what is this
“civilization” in which we find ourselves? What are
these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why
should we make money out of them? Where in
short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of
educated men?

This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is
Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,
but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the
doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The
poor market may be slowing innovation, but
advances continue; judging by the mood this week at
the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in
Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
    The technology that’s surprised almost everyone
is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,
silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and
Martin Green, professor at the University of
New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar
panel researchers, declared that they’d never go
below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like
50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per
watt,” he says.
    The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of
reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar
panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020.
Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target
even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the
direct cost of solar power to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost
expected for power from new natural gas power
plants.
    All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have
been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the
power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady
cost reductions. Green points to something as
mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of
the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar
cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon
solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To
achieve that record, he had to use expensive
lithography techniques to make fine wires for
collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual
improvements have made it possible to use screen
printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research
suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce
lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of
the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at
costs far lower than his lithography techniques.
    Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a
new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,
which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar
cell they made is the only current challenger to
silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film
cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower
the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power
cheaper.
    One of Green’s former students and colleagues,
Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer
China Sunergy, announced this week that he is
building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided
solar cell that can absorb light from both the front
and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that
during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the
land between rows of solar panels in a solar power
plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels
and could be harvested to increase the power output.
This works particularly well when the solar panels
are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a
one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a
two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He
expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more
electricity over the course of a year.
    Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,
aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in
cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to
greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels
by combining silicon with one or two other
semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a
part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert
efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost
efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to
around 40 percent. Adding another could make
efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which
would cut in half the number of solar panels needed
for a given installation. The challenge is to produce
good connections between these semiconductors,
something made challenging by the arrangement of
silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”



Question 5:
Miss Spivey most likely uses the phrase “fruitful intermission” (line 26) to indicate that
A) she benefited from taking time off from her studies in order to travel.
B) her travels with Janet Miller encouraged her to start medical school.
C) her early years at boarding school resulted in unanticipated rewards.

This passage is adapted from Jeffrey Mervis, “Why Null
Results Rarely See the Light of Day.” ©2014 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.


    The question of what to do with null
results—when researchers fail to see an effect that
should be detectable—has long been hotly debated
among those conducting medical trials, where the
results can have a big impact on lives and corporate
bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to
the social and behavioral sciences, which also have
the potential to sway public and social policy.
There were little hard data, however, on how often or
why null results were squelched. “Yes, it’s true that
null results are not as exciting,” political scientist
Gary King of Harvard University says. “But I suspect
another reason they are rarely published is that there
are many, many ways to produce null results by
messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.”
    In a recent study, Stanford political economist
Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students
examined every study since 2002 that was funded by
a competitive grants program called TESS
(Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences).
TESS allows scientists to order up Internet-based
surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test
a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters
tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal
dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus
on policy matters).
    Malhotra’s team tracked down working papers
from most of the experiments that weren’t published,
and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to
their results. In their e-mailed responses, some
scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more
pressing matters—but many also believed the
journals just wouldn’t be interested. “The
unfortunate reality of the publishing world [is] that
null effects do not tell a clear story,” said one
scientist. Said another, “Never published, definitely
disappointed to not see any major effects.”
    Their answers suggest to Malhotra that rescuing
findings from the file drawer will require a shift in
expectations. “What needs to change is the
culture—the author’s belief about what will happen if
the research is written up,” he says.
    Not unexpectedly, the statistical strength of the
findings made a huge difference in whether they
were ever published. Overall, 42% of the experiments
produced statistically significant results. Of those,
62% were ultimately published, compared with 21%
of the null results. However, the Stanford team was
surprised that researchers didn’t even write up
65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.
    Scientists not involved in the study praise its
“clever” design. “It’s a very important paper” that
“starts to put numbers on things we want to
understand,” says economist Edward Miguel of the
University of California, Berkeley.
    He and others note that the bias against null
studies can waste time and money when researchers
devise new studies replicating strategies already
found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish
significant results from similar experiments in the
future, they could look stronger than they should
because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even
more troubling to Malhotra was the fact that two
scientists whose initial studies “didn’t work out”
went on to publish results based on a smaller sample.
“The non-TESS version of the same study, in which
we used a student sample, did yield fruit,” noted one
investigator.
    A registry for data generated by all experiments
would address these problems, the authors argue.
They say it should also include a “preanalysis” plan,
that is, a detailed description of what the scientist
hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed.
Such plans would help deter researchers from
tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in
search of more publishable results.



Question 16:
Based on the passage, to which of the following hypothetical situations would Malhotra most strongly object?
A) A research team refuses to publish null results in anything less than a top journal.
B) A research team excludes the portion of data that produced null results when reporting its results in a journal.
C) A research team unknowingly repeats a study that produced null results for another research team.
D) A research team performs a follow-up study that expands the scope of an initial study that produced null results.

What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We
Live. ©2013 by Marlene Zuk.

    A female guppy can be sexually mature at two
months of age and have her first babies just a month
later. This unstinting rate of reproduction makes
Line guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of
evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC
Riverside, has been doing exactly that for the last few
decades.
    People usually think of guppies as colorful
aquarium fish, but they also have a life in the real
world, inhabiting streams and rivers in tropical
places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his
fieldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of
conditions depending on the luck of the draw.
A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of
rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike
cichlids found in calmer downstream waters. As you
might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the
proportion of individuals that die—is much higher in
the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those
without them.
    Reznick has shown that if you bring the fish into
the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from
the sites with many predators become sexually
mature when they are younger and smaller than do
the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition,
the litters of baby guppies produced by mothers from
the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual
baby is smaller than those produced by their
counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if
you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have
babies sooner, and spreading your energy reserves
over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will
manage to pass on some of your genes before you
meet your fate. Reznick and other scientists also
demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the
guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which they
grow up.
    How quickly, though, could these differences in
how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have
evolved? Because there are numerous tributaries of
the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some
but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as
he put it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test
tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places
they had not originally occurred, and then watch as
natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called
“experimental evolution,” and it is growing
increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for
humans to be able to see the outcome within our
lifetimes.
    Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick
removed groups of guppies from their predator
ridden lives below the waterfall and released them
into previously guppy-free streams above the falls.
Although small predatory killifish occurred in these
new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the
danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for
nature to do its work, and they brought the
descendants of the transplanted fish back to the lab
to examine their reproduction. After just eleven
years, the guppies released in the new streams had
evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger
offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that
naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams.
Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown
evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years,
or a little over four generations, with more time
required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability
to form schools and less time for changes in the
colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.



Question 26:
Which finding, if accurate, would undermine Reznick’s findings?
A) Guppies examined in other parts of the globe exhibit genetic shifts in traits at a different rate from that exhibited by the guppies Reznick examined.
B) The new site into which Reznick released the guppies is inhabited by fish that are found to be as predatory as the cichlids in the original sites.
C) Experimental evolution is shown to be harmful to the environments where studies like Reznick’s are conducted.
D) The descendants of Reznick’s transplanted fish are proven to mature later than the guppies living below the waterfall.

This passage is adapted from Daniel Chamovitz, What a
Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses. ©2012 by
Daniel Chamovitz

    The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
    We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.



Question 52:
Based on the passage, in studying the Venus flytrap, Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of which type of evidence?
A) Mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap
B) Analysis of data collected from previous researchers’ work involving the Venus flytrap’s response to electricity
C) Information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap’s response to varying amounts of electrical current
D) Published theories of scientists who developed earlier models of the Venus flytrap

This passage is adapted from Iain King, “Can Economics Be
Ethical?” ©2013 by Prospect Publishing.

    Recent debates about the economy have
rediscovered the question, “is that right?”, where
“right” means more than just profits or efficiency.
Some argue that because the free markets allow
for personal choice, they are already ethical. Others
have accepted the ethical critique and embraced
corporate social responsibility. But before we can
label any market outcome as “immoral,” or sneer at
economists who try to put a price on being ethical,
we need to be clear on what we are talking about.
    There are different views on where ethics should
apply when someone makes an economic decision.
Consider Adam Smith, widely regarded as the
founder of modern economics. He was a moral
philosopher who believed sympathy for others was
the basis for ethics (we would call it empathy
nowadays). But one of his key insights in The Wealth
of Nations was that acting on this empathy could be
counter-productive—he observed people becoming
better off when they put their own empathy aside,
and interacted in a self-interested way. Smith justifies
selfish behavior by the outcome. Whenever planners
use cost-benefit analysis to justify a new railway line,
or someone retrains to boost his or her earning
power, or a shopper buys one to get one free, they are
using the same approach: empathizing with
someone, and seeking an outcome that makes that
person as well off as possible—although the person
they are empathizing with may be themselves in the
future.
   Instead of judging consequences, Aristotle
said ethics was about having the right
character—displaying virtues like courage and
honesty. It is a view put into practice whenever
business leaders are chosen for their good character.
But it is a hard philosophy to teach—just how much
loyalty should you show to a manufacturer that keeps
losing money? Show too little and you’re a “greed is
good” corporate raider; too much and you’re wasting
money on unproductive capital. Aristotle thought
there was a golden mean between the two extremes,
and finding it was a matter of fine judgment. But if
ethics is about character, it’s not clear what those
characteristics should be.
    There is yet another approach: instead of rooting
ethics in character or the consequences of actions, we
can focus on our actions themselves. From this
perspective some things are right, some wrong—we
should buy fair trade goods, we shouldn’t tell lies in
advertisements. Ethics becomes a list of
commandments, a catalog of “dos” and “don’ts.”
When a finance official refuses to devalue a currency
because they have promised not to, they are defining
ethics this way. According to this approach
devaluation can still be bad, even if it would make
everybody better off.
    Many moral dilemmas arise when these three
versions pull in different directions but clashes are
not inevitable. Take fair trade coffee (coffee that is
sold with a certification that indicates the farmers
and workers who produced it were paid a fair wage),
for example: buying it might have good
consequences, be virtuous, and also be the right way
to act in a flawed market. Common ground like this
suggests that, even without agreement on where
ethics applies, ethical economics is still possible.
    Whenever we feel queasy about “perfect”
competitive markets, the problem is often rooted in a
phony conception of people. The model of man on
which classical economics is based—an entirely
rational and selfish being—is a parody, as
John Stuart Mill, the philosopher who pioneered the
model, accepted. Most people—even economists—
now accept that this “economic man” is a fiction.
We behave like a herd; we fear losses more than we
hope for gains; rarely can our brains process all the
relevant facts.
    These human quirks mean we can never make
purely “rational” decisions. A new wave of behavioral
economists, aided by neuroscientists, is trying to
understand our psychology, both alone and in
groups, so they can anticipate our decisions in the
marketplace more accurately. But psychology can
also help us understand why we react in disgust at
economic injustice, or accept a moral law as
universal. Which means that the relatively new
science of human behavior might also define ethics
for us. Ethical economics would then emerge from
one of the least likely places: economists themselves.

This passage is adapted from Kevin Bullis, “What Tech Is
Next for the Solar Industry?” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,
but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the
doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The
poor market may be slowing innovation, but
advances continue; judging by the mood this week at
the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in
Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
    The technology that’s surprised almost everyone
is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,
silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and
Martin Green, professor at the University of
New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar
panel researchers, declared that they’d never go
below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like
50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per
watt,” he says.
    The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of
reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar
panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020.
Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target
even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the
direct cost of solar power to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost
expected for power from new natural gas power
plants.
    All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have
been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the
power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady
cost reductions. Green points to something as
mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of
the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar
cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon
solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To
achieve that record, he had to use expensive
lithography techniques to make fine wires for
collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual
improvements have made it possible to use screen
printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research
suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce
lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of
the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at
costs far lower than his lithography techniques.
    Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a
new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,
which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar
cell they made is the only current challenger to
silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film
cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower
the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power
cheaper.
    One of Green’s former students and colleagues,
Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer
China Sunergy, announced this week that he is
building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided
solar cell that can absorb light from both the front
and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that
during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the
land between rows of solar panels in a solar power
plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels
and could be harvested to increase the power output.
This works particularly well when the solar panels
are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a
one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a
two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He
expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more
electricity over the course of a year.
    Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,
aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in
cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to
greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels
by combining silicon with one or two other
semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a
part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert
efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost
efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to
around 40 percent. Adding another could make
efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which
would cut in half the number of solar panels needed
for a given installation. The challenge is to produce
good connections between these semiconductors,
something made challenging by the arrangement of
silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.



Question 46:
In the second paragraph (lines 15-31), the discussion of short-term memory primarily functions to
A) clarify an explanation of what prompts the Venus flytrap to close.
B) advance a controversial hypothesis about the function of electric charges found in the leaf of the Venus flytrap.
C) stress the distinction between the strategies of the Venus flytrap and the strategies of human beings.
D) emphasize the Venus flytrap’s capacity for retaining detailed information about its prey.

This passage is adapted from Stephen Coleman, Scott
Anthony, and David E. Morrison, “Public Trust in the News.”
©2009 by Stephen Coleman.

    The news is a form of public knowledge.
Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the
health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a
private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge
increases in value as it is shared by more people. The
date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;
the causes and consequences of an environmental
disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular
law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all
examples of public knowledge that people are
generally expected to know in order to be considered
informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or
private knowledge, which is generally left to
individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is
promoted even to those who might not think it
matters to them. In short, the circulation of public
knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded
as a public good which cannot be solely
demand-driven.
    The production, circulation, and reception
of public knowledge is a complex process. It is
generally accepted that public knowledge should
be authoritative, but there is not always
common agreement about what the public needs to
know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and
how authoritative reputations should be determined
and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The
Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely
regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative
agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied
the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of
authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the
opinions of others.” As part of the general process of
the transformation of authority whereby there has
been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional
sources of public knowledge, the demand has been
for all authority to make explicit the frames of value
which determine their decisions. Centres of news
production, as our focus groups show, have not been
exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps
some news journalists feel uneasy about this
renegotiation of their authority:
    Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the
    “most read” lists on their own and other websites
    to work out which stories matter to readers and
    viewers. And now the audience—which used to
    know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of
    journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our
    credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008).
    The result of democratising access to TV news
    could be political disengagement by the majority
    and a dumbing down through a popularity
    contest of stories (online news editor, 2007).
    Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,
they amount to more than straightforward
professional defensiveness. In their reference to an
audience “which used to know its place” and
conflation between democratisation and “dumbing
down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular
mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by
experts, immune from populist pressures; and
disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive
recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down
opportunities for popular involvement in the making
of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional
claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are
right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every
institutional level in contemporary society,
scepticism towards the epistemological authority of
expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed
by several of our focus group participants, that the
news media should be “informative rather than
authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to
“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their
slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient
information” from which “we would be able to form
opinions of our own.”
    At stake here are two distinct conceptions of
authority. The journalists we have quoted are
resistant to the democratisation of news:
the supremacy of the clickstream (according to
which editors raise or lower the profile of stories
according to the number of readers clicking on them
online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”
news; the demands of some audience members for
raw news rather than constructed narratives.




Question 16:
The authors indicate that the public is coming to believe that journalists’ reports should avoid
A) personal judgments about the events reported.
B) more information than is absolutely necessary.
C) quotations from authorities on the subject matter.
D) details that the subjects of news reports wish to keep private.

This passage is adapted from David Rotman, “How
Technology Is Destroying Jobs.” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    MIT business scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee have argued that impressive
advances in computer technology—from improved
industrial robotics to automated translation
services—are largely behind the sluggish
employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
more ominous for workers, they foresee dismal
prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful
new technologies are increasingly adopted not only
in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in
professions such as law, financial services, education,
and medicine.
    That robots, automation, and software can replace
people might seem obvious to anyone who’s worked
in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But
Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s claim is more troubling
and controversial. They believe that rapid
technological change has been destroying jobs faster
than it is creating them, contributing to the
stagnation of median income and the growth of
inequality in the United States. And, they suspect,
something similar is happening in other
technologically advanced countries.
    As evidence, Brynjolfsson and McAfee point to a
chart that only an economist could love. In
economics, productivity—the amount of economic
value created for a given unit of input, such as an
hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and
wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the
chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines
represent productivity and total employment in the
United States. For years after World War II, the
two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in
jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The
pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value
from their workers, the country as a whole became
richer, which fueled more economic activity and
created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the
lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,
but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a
significant gap appears between the two lines,
showing economic growth with no parallel increase
in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the
“great decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is
confident that technology is behind both the healthy
growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.
    It’s a startling assertion because it threatens the
faith that many economists place in technological
progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that
technology boosts productivity and makes societies
wealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark
side: technological progress is eliminating the need
for many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker
worse off than before. Brynjolfsson can point to a
second chart indicating that median income is failing
to rise even as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s
the great paradox of our era,” he says. “Productivity
is at record levels, innovation has never been faster,
and yet at the same time, we have a falling median
income and we have fewer jobs. People are falling
behind because technology is advancing so fast and
our skills and organizations aren’t keeping up.”
    While technological changes can be painful for
workers whose skills no longer match the needs of
employers, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist,
says that no historical pattern shows these shifts
leading to a net decrease in jobs over an extended
period. Katz has done extensive research on how
technological advances have affected jobs over the
last few centuries—describing, for example, how
highly skilled artisans in the mid-19th century were
displaced by lower-skilled workers in factories.
While it can take decades for workers to acquire the
expertise needed for new types of employment, he
says, “we never have run out of jobs. There is no
long-term trend of eliminating work for people. Over
the long term, employment rates are fairly
stable. People have always been able to create new
jobs. People come up with new things to do.”
    Still, Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is
something different about today’s digital
technologies—something that could affect an even
broader range of work. The question, he says, is
whether economic history will serve as a useful
guide. Will the job disruptions caused by technology
be temporary as the workforce adapts, or will we see
a science-fiction scenario in which automated
processes and robots with superhuman skills take
over a broad swath of human tasks? Though Katz
expects the historical pattern to hold, it is “genuinely
a question,” he says. “If technology disrupts enough,
who knows what will happen?”

This passage is adapted from Brian Greene, “How the Higgs
Boson Was Found.” ©2013 by Smithsonian Institution. The
Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the
Higgs field. Experiments conducted in 2012–2013
tentatively confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and
thus of the Higgs field.

    Nearly a half-century ago, Peter Higgs and a
handful of other physicists were trying to understand
the origin of a basic physical feature: mass. You can
think of mass as an object’s heft or, a little more
precisely, as the resistance it offers to having its
motion changed. Push on a freight train (or a
feather) to increase its speed, and the resistance you
feel reflects its mass. At a microscopic level, the
freight train’s mass comes from its constituent
molecules and atoms, which are themselves built
from fundamental particles, electrons and quarks.
But where do the masses of these and other
fundamental particles come from?
    When physicists in the 1960s modeled the
behavior of these particles using equations rooted in
quantum physics, they encountered a puzzle. If they
imagined that the particles were all massless, then
each term in the equations clicked into a perfectly
symmetric pattern, like the tips of a perfect
snowflake. And this symmetry was not just
mathematically elegant. It explained patterns evident
in the experimental data. But—and here’s the
puzzle—physicists knew that the particles did have
mass, and when they modified the equations to
account for this fact, the mathematical harmony was
spoiled. The equations became complex and
unwieldy and, worse still, inconsistent.
    What to do? Here’s the idea put forward by Higgs.
Don’t shove the particles’ masses down the throat of
the beautiful equations. Instead, keep the equations
pristine and symmetric, but consider them operating
within a peculiar environment. Imagine that all of
space is uniformly filled with an invisible
substance—now called the Higgs field—that exerts a
drag force on particles when they accelerate through
it. Push on a fundamental particle in an effort to
increase its speed and, according to Higgs, you would
feel this drag force as a resistance. Justifiably, you
would interpret the resistance as the particle’s mass.
For a mental toehold, think of a ping-pong ball
submerged in water. When you push on the
ping-pong ball, it will feel much more massive than it
does outside of water. Its interaction with the watery
environment has the effect of endowing it with mass.
So with particles submerged in the Higgs field.
    In 1964, Higgs submitted a paper to a prominent
physics journal in which he formulated this idea
mathematically. The paper was rejected. Not because
it contained a technical error, but because the
premise of an invisible something permeating space,
interacting with particles to provide their mass, well,
it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought
speculation. The editors of the journal deemed it “of
no obvious relevance to physics.”
    But Higgs persevered (and his revised paper
appeared later that year in another journal), and
physicists who took the time to study the proposal
gradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius,
one that allowed them to have their cake and eat it
too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations
can retain their pristine form because the dirty work
of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the
environment.
    While I wasn’t around to witness the initial
rejection of Higgs’s proposal in 1964 (well, I was
around, but only barely), I can attest that by the
mid-1980s, the assessment had changed. The physics
community had, for the most part, fully bought into
the idea that there was a Higgs field permeating
space. In fact, in a graduate course I took that
covered what’s known as the Standard Model of
Particle Physics (the quantum equations physicists
have assembled to describe the particles of matter
and the dominant forces by which they influence
each other), the professor presented the Higgs field
with such certainty that for a long while I had no idea
it had yet to be established experimentally.
On occasion, that happens in physics. Mathematical
equations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale,
they can seemingly radiate reality so strongly, that
they become entrenched in the vernacular of
working physicists, even before there’s data to
confirm them.

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.
Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the
only way in which capacities can be proved,—by
trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best
faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere
beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that
whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of
mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those
faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only
in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the
qualities which are not permitted to be exercised
shall not exist.



Question 41:
Based on Passage 2, Mill would most likely say that the application of the “great principle of political economy” (lines 38-39, Passage 1) to gender roles has which effect?
A) It prevents many men and women from developing to their full potential.
B) It makes it difficult for men and women to sympathize with each other.
C) It unintentionally furthers the cause of gender equality.
D) It guarantees that women take occupations that men are better suited to perform.

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the
Texas gourd study.



Question 31:
According to the passage, Theis and Adler’s research offers an answer to which of the following questions?
A) How can Texas gourd plants increase the number of visits they receive from pollinators?
B) Why is there an upper limit on the intensity of the aroma emitted by Texas gourd plants?
C) Why does hand pollination rescue the fruit weight of beetle-infested Texas gourd plants?

Passage 1 is adapted from Michael Slezak, “Space Mining:
the Next Gold Rush?” ©2013 by New Scientist. Passage 2 is
from the editors of New Scientist, “Taming the Final
Frontier.” ©2013 by New Scientist.

Passage 1
    Follow the money and you will end up in space.
That’s the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on
mining beyond Earth.
    Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for
Space Engineering Research, the event brought
together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar
scientists, and government agencies that are all
working to make space mining a reality.
    The forum comes hot on the heels of the
2012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms.
Planetary Resources of Washington says it will
launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years,
while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be
harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020. Another
commercial venture that sprung up in 2012,
Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to
the moon, including to potential lunar miners.
    Within a few decades, these firms may be
meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as
platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital
for personal electronics, such as yttrium and
lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who
transformed the western United States, the first space
miners won’t just enrich themselves. They also hope
to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds
with Earth, in which the materials extracted and
processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered
for space-based projects.
    In this scenario, water mined from other
worlds could become the most desired commodity.
“In the desert, what’s worth more: a kilogram of gold
or a kilogram of water?” asks Kris Zacny of
HoneyBee Robotics in New York. “Gold is useless.
Water will let you live.”
    Water ice from the moon’s poles could be sent to
astronauts on the International Space Station for
drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into
oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so
ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary
refuelling stations.
    Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and
aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could
be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or
machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into
concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.

Passage 2
    The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting
from discovery to economics. The past year has seen
a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches
down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few
billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain:
the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could
enrich us all.
    But before the miners start firing up their rockets,
we should pause for thought. At first glance, space
mining seems to sidestep most environmental
concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids,
and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences
—both here on Earth and in space—merit careful
consideration.
    Part of this is about principles. Some will argue
that space’s “magnificent desolation” is not ours to
despoil, just as they argue that our own planet’s poles
should remain pristine. Others will suggest that
glutting ourselves on space’s riches is not an
acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable
ways of earthly life.
    History suggests that those will be hard lines to
hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public
that such barren environments are worth preserving.
After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even
fewer people will experience them than have walked
through Antarctica’s icy landscapes.
    There’s also the emerging off-world economy to
consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and
beyond may be very different to those we prize on
Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely
been broached—and the relevant legal and regulatory
framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.
    Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are
often reluctant to engage with such questions.
One speaker at last week’s space-mining forum in
Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that
regulation should be avoided. But miners have much
to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit
exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will
be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made
insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek
one out.

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.



Question 48:
The main purpose of the fifth paragraph (lines 57-65) is to
A) relate Maguire’s study of mental athletes to her study of taxi drivers.
B) speculate on the reason for Maguire’s unexpected results.
C) identify an important finding of Maguire’s study of mental athletes.

Passage 1 is adapted from Edmund Burke, Reflections on the
Revolution in France. Originally published in 1790. Passage 2
is adapted from Thomas Paine, Rights of Man. Originally
published in 1791.

Passage 1
    To avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and
versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of
obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have
consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions but with due
caution; that he should never dream of beginning its
reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of
a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By
this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him
into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their
poisonous weeds, and wild incantations, they may
regenerate the paternal constitution, and renovate
their father’s life.
    Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts
for objects of mere occasional interest may be
dissolved at pleasure—but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or
tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken
up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved
by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with
other reverence; because it is not a partnership in
things subservient only to the gross animal existence
of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a
partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
only between those who are living, but between those
who are living, those who are dead, and those who
are to be born. . . . The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at
their pleasure, and on their speculations of a
contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear
asunder the bands of their subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos of elementary principles.

Passage 2
    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is
the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who
are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each
other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagination
can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can
exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid
down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence,
and the other not in, and who never can meet in this
world, that the one should control the other to the
end of time?...
    The circumstances of the world are continually
changing, and the opinions of men change also; and
as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in
one age, may be thought wrong and found
inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to
decide, the living, or the dead?



Question 36:
How would Paine most likely respond to Burke’s statement in lines 30-34, Passage 1 (“As the... born”)?
A) He would assert that the notion of a partnership across generations is less plausible to people of his era than it was to people in the past.
B) He would argue that there are no politically meaningful links between the dead, the living, and the unborn.
C) He would question the possibility that significant changes to a political system could be accomplished within a single generation.
D) He would point out that we cannot know what judgments the dead would make about contemporary issues.

This passage is adapted from Daniyal Mueenuddin,
“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
    The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
    “What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”
    “Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
    “And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
    The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
    The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.

The main purpose of the first paragraph is to
A) characterize Nawab as a loving father.
B) outline the schedule of a typical day in Nawab’s life.

This passage is adapted from MacDonald Harris,
The Balloonist. ©2011 by The Estate of Donald Heiney.
During the summer of 1897, the narrator of this story, a
fictional Swedish scientist, has set out for the North Pole
in a hydrogen-powered balloon.

    My emotions are complicated and not
readily verifiable. I feel a vast yearning that is
simultaneously a pleasure and a pain. I am certain
of the consummation of this yearning, but I don’t
know yet what form it will take, since I do not
understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.
For the first time there is borne in upon me the full
truth of what I myself said to the doctor only an hour
ago: that my motives in this undertaking are not
entirely clear. For years, for a lifetime, the machinery
of my destiny has worked in secret to prepare for this
moment; its clockwork has moved exactly toward
this time and place and no other. Rising slowly from
the earth that bore me and gave me sustenance, I am
carried helplessly toward an uninhabited and hostile,
or at best indifferent, part of the earth, littered with
the bones of explorers and the wrecks of ships, frozen
supply caches, messages scrawled with chilled fingers
and hidden in cairns that no eye will ever see.
Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have
died. Yet in freely willing this enterprise, in choosing
this moment and no other when the south wind
will carry me exactly northward at a velocity of
eight knots, I have converted the machinery of my
fate into the servant of my will. All this I understand,
as I understand each detail of the technique by which
this is carried out. What I don’t understand is why I
am so intent on going to this particular place. Who
wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat
it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like
a railway? The Danish ministers have declared from
their pulpits that participation in polar expeditions is
beneficial to the soul’s eternal well-being, or so I read
in a newspaper. It isn’t clear how this doctrine is to
be interpreted, except that the Pole is something
difficult or impossible to attain which must
nevertheless be sought for, because man is
condemned to seek out and know everything
whether or not the knowledge gives him pleasure. In
short, it is the same unthinking lust for knowledge
that drove our First Parents out of the garden.
    And suppose you were to find it in spite of all, this
wonderful place that everybody is so anxious to stand
on! What would you find? Exactly nothing.
A point precisely identical to all the others in a
completely featureless wasteland stretching around it
for hundreds of miles. It is an abstraction, a
mathematical fiction. No one but a Swedish madman
could take the slightest interest in it. Here I am. The
wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily
northward at the speed of a trotting dog. Behind us,
perhaps forever, lie the Cities of Men with their
teacups and their brass bedsteads. I am going forth of
my own volition to join the ghosts of Bering and
poor Franklin, of frozen De Long and his men.
What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not
an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself. The
doctor was right, even though I dislike him.
Fundamentally I am a dangerous madman, and what
I do is both a challenge to my egotism and a
surrender to it.

This passage is adapted from Richard J. Sharpe and Lisa
Heyden, “Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder is Possibly
Caused by a Dietary Pyrethrum Deficiency.” ©2009 by
Elsevier Ltd. Colony collapse disorder is characterized by the
disappearance of adult worker bees from hives.

    Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large
ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites).
These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can
kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility
to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
Little is known about the natural defenses that keep
the mite infections under control.
    Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which
include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and
related species. These plants produce potent
insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally
occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums.
A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is
pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are
known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite
infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is
treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
    We suspect that the bees of commercial bee
colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally
deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem
is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums,
and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in
such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on
the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are
susceptible to mite infestations which can become
fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of
immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees.
This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or
fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens.
In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally
deficient bees may be further weakened when
commercially produced insecticides are introduced
into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight
mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper
dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be
better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid
pyrethrum containing plants depending on the
amount necessary to defend against mites and the
amount already consumed by the bees, which in
higher doses could be potentially toxic to them.
    This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial
wherein a small number of commercial honey bee
colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum
producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source
such as clover, while controls are offered only the
clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive
with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the
effects of the mite parasites on the experimental
colonies versus control colonies.
    It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee
colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be
some genetic difference between them that affects the
bees’ preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.

This passage is adapted from J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick,
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid.” ©1953 by Nature Publishing Group. Watson and Crick
deduced the structure of DNA using evidence from Rosalind
Franklin and R. G. Gosling’s X-ray crystallography diagrams
of DNA and from Erwin Chargaff’s data on the base
composition of DNA.

    The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a
very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a
regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.
To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which
can be of four different types. Two of the possible
bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the
other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.
So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the
chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of
phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.
    The first feature of our structure which is of
biological interest is that it consists not of one chain,
but of two. These two chains are both coiled around
a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that
since there was only one chain in the chemical
formula there would only be one in the structural
unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray
evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.
    The other biologically important feature is the
manner in which the two chains are held together.
This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases.
The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base
from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single
base from the other. The important point is that only
certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.
One member of a pair must be a purine and the other
a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two
chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for
example, there would not be room for it.
    We believe that the bases will be present almost
entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true,
the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are:
adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine.
Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but
when it does, its partner on the other chain must
always be thymine.
    The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is
completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of
bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a
long molecule many different permutations are
possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise
sequence of bases is the code which carries the
genetical information. If the actual order of the bases
on one of the pair of chains were given, one could
write down the exact order of the bases on the other
one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain
is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule might duplicate itself.

This passage is adapted from Rachel Ehrenberg, “Salt
Stretches in Nanoworld.” ©2009 by Society for Science & the
Public. The “nanoworld” is the world observed on a scale
one billionth that of ordinary human experience.

    Inflexible old salt becomes a softy in the
nanoworld, stretching like taffy to more than twice
its length, researchers report. The findings may lead
to new approaches for making nanowires that could
end up in solar cells or electronic circuits. The work
also suggests that these ultra-tiny salt wires may
already exist in sea spray and large underground salt
deposits.
    “We think nanowires are special and go to great
lengths to make them,” says study coauthor
Nathan Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque. “Maybe they are more common than
we think.”
    Metals such as gold or lead, in which bonding
angles are loosey-goosey, can stretch out at
temperatures well below their melting points.
But scientists don’t expect this superplasticity in a
rigid, crystalline material like salt, Moore says.
    This unusual behavior highlights that different
forces rule the nanoworld, says theoretical physicist
Krzysztof Kempa of Boston College. “Forget about
gravity. It plays no role,” he says. Surface tension and
electrostatic forces are much more important at this
scale.
    Moore and his colleagues discovered salt’s
stretchiness accidently. They were investigating how
water sticks to a surface such as salt and created a
super-dry salt sample for testing. After cleaving a
chunk of salt about the size of a sugar cube with a
razor, the scientists guided a microscope that detects
forces toward the surface. When the tip was far away
there was no measured force, but within about seven
nanometers a very strong attraction rapidly
developed between the diamond tip of the
microscope and the salt. The salt actually stretched
out to glom on to the microscope tip. Using an
electron microscope to see what was happening, the
researchers observed the nanowires.
    The initial attraction between the tip and salt
might be due to electrostatic forces, perhaps good old
van der Waals interactions, the researchers
speculate. Several mechanisms might lead to the
elasticity, including the excessive surface tension
found in the nanoworld (the same tension that allows
a water strider to skim the surface of a pond).
    The surface tension is so strong that as the
microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt
stretches, Kempa says. “The inside has no choice but
to rearrange the atoms, rather than break,” he says.
    This bizarre behavior is actually mirrored in the
macroworld, the researchers say. Huge underground
deposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is
believed to play a role at these scales. Perhaps salty
nanowires are present in these deposits as well.
    “Sodium chloride is everywhere—in the air, in
our bodies,” Moore says. “This may change our view
of things, of what’s happening at the nanoscale.”
    The work also suggests new techniques for
making nanowires, which are often created through
nano-imprinting techniques, Kempa says. “We
invoke the intuition of the macroworld,” he says.
“Maybe instead of stamping [nanowires] we should
be nano-pulling them.”

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled
with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left
to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify
the protein. Et voilà—human medicine! And, for
GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006,
becoming the world’s first transgenic animal drug.
Over the course of a year, the “milking parlors” on
GTC’s 300-acre farm in Massachusetts can collect
more than a kilogram of medicine from a single
animal.

This passage is adapted from Bryan Walsh, “Whole Food
Blues: Why Organic Agriculture May Not Be So Sustainable.”
©2012 by Time Inc.

    When it comes to energy, everyone loves
efficiency. Cutting energy waste is one of those goals
that both sides of the political divide can agree on,
even if they sometimes diverge on how best to get
there. Energy efficiency allows us to get more out of
our given resources, which is good for the economy
and (mostly) good for the environment as well. In
an increasingly hot and crowded world, the only
sustainable way to live is to get more out of less.
Every environmentalist would agree.
    But change the conversation to food, and
suddenly efficiency doesn’t look so good.
Conventional industrial agriculture has become
incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis.
Thanks to fertilizers, mechanization and irrigation,
each American farmer feeds over 155 people
worldwide. Conventional farming gets more and
more crop per square foot of cultivated land—
over 170 bushels of corn per acre in Iowa, for
example—which can mean less territory needs to
be converted from wilderness to farmland.
And since a third of the planet is already used for
agriculture—destroying forests and other wild
habitats along the way—anything that could help us
produce more food on less land would seem to be
good for the environment.
    Of course, that’s not how most environmentalists
regard their arugula [a leafy green]. They have
embraced organic food as better for the planet—and
healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by
agricultural corporations. Environmentalists disdain
the enormous amounts of energy needed and waste
created by conventional farming, while organic
practices—forgoing artificial fertilizers and chemical
pesticides—are considered far more sustainable.
Sales of organic food rose 7.7% in 2010, up to $26.7
billion—and people are making those purchases for
their consciences as much as their taste buds.
    Yet a new meta-analysis in Nature does the math
and comes to a hard conclusion: organic farming
yields 25% fewer crops on average than conventional
agriculture. More land is therefore needed to
produce fewer crops—and that means organic
farming may not be as good for the planet as
we think.
    In the Nature analysis, scientists from McGill
University in Montreal and the University of
Minnesota performed an analysis of 66 studies
comparing conventional and organic methods across
34 different crop species, from fruits to grains to
legumes. They found that organic farming delivered
a lower yield for every crop type, though the disparity
varied widely. For rain-watered legume crops like
beans or perennial crops like fruit trees, organic
trailed conventional agriculture by just 5%. Yet for
major cereal crops like corn or wheat, as well as most
vegetables—all of which provide the bulk of the
world’s calories—conventional agriculture
outperformed organics by more than 25%.
    The main difference is nitrogen, the chemical key
to plant growth. Conventional agriculture makes use
of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each
year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant
growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the
compost or cover crops used in organic farming.
When we talk about a Green Revolution, we really
mean a nitrogen revolution—along with a lot
of water.
    But not all the nitrogen used in conventional
fertilizer ends up in crops—much of it ends up
running off the soil and into the oceans, creating vast
polluted dead zones. We’re already putting more
nitrogen into the soil than the planet can stand over
the long term. And conventional agriculture also
depends heavily on chemical pesticides, which can
have unintended side effects.
    What that means is that while conventional
agriculture is more efficient—sometimes much more
efficient—than organic farming, there are trade-offs
with each. So an ideal global agriculture system, in
the views of the study’s authors, may borrow the best
from both systems, as Jonathan Foley of the
University of Minnesota explained:
   The bottom line? Today’s organic farming
   practices are probably best deployed in fruit and
   vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not
   just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for
   delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple
   crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on,
   conventional farms have the advantage right
   now.
   Looking forward, I think we will need to deploy
   different kinds of practices (especially new,
   mixed approaches that take the best of organic
   and conventional farming systems) where they
   are best suited—geographically, economically,
   socially, etc.

Passage 1 is adapted from Nicholas Carr, “Author
Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains.”
©2010 by Condé Nast. Passage 2 is from Steven Pinker,
“Mind over Mass Media.” ©2010 by The New York Times

Passage 1
    The mental consequences of our online
info-crunching are not universally bad.
Certain cognitive skills are strengthened by our use
of computers and the Net. These tend to involve
more primitive mental functions, such as hand-eye
coordination, reflex response, and the processing of
visual cues. One much-cited study of video gaming
revealed that after just 10 days of playing action
games on computers, a group of young people had
significantly boosted the speed with which they could
shift their visual focus between various images and
tasks.
     It’s likely that Web browsing also strengthens
brain functions related to fast-paced problem
solving, particularly when it requires spotting
patterns in a welter of data. A British study of the
way women search for medical information online
indicated that an experienced Internet user can, at
least in some cases, assess the trustworthiness and
probable value of a Web page in a matter of seconds.
The more we practice surfing and scanning, the more
adept our brain becomes at those tasks.
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly
at such benefits and conclude that the Web is making
us smarter. In a Science article published in early
2009, prominent developmental psychologist Patricia
Greenfield reviewed more than 40 studies of the
effects of various types of media on intelligence and
learning ability. She concluded that “every medium
develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.

Passage 1 is adapted from Abraham Lincoln, “Address to the
Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.” Originally
delivered in 1838. Passage 2 is from Henry David Thoreau,
“Resistance to Civil Government.” Originally published
in 1849.

Passage 1
    Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong....
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.



Question 33:
In Passage 1, Lincoln contends that breaking the law has which consequence?
A) It slows the repeal of bad laws.
B) It undermines and repudiates the nation’s values.
C) It leads slowly but inexorably to rule by the mob.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted

This passage is adapted from Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle
S. Adams, ""Money Can't Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs about
Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation."" ©2008 by Elsevier
Inc.

    Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
full force—both online and on foot—searching
frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
that their purchases will disappoint rather than
delight the intended recipients.
    Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
social process, serving various political, religious, and
psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
not very good at predicting what gifts others will
appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
psychologists. Research has found that people often
struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
projection, and multiple attribution errors.
    What is surprising is that gift-givers have
considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and
gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend
each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.
In the present research, we propose a unique
psychological explanation for this overspending
problem—i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they
spend with how much recipients will appreciate the
gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a
gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation). Although a
link between gift price and feelings of appreciation
might seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an
assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose
that gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their
feelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift
than givers assume.
    Why do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely
linked to gift-recipients’ feelings of appreciation?
Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more
expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of
thoughtfulness and consideration. According to
Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a
symbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal
their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future
relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be
motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to
send a “stronger signal” to their intended recipient.
As for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller
and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger
signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.
    The notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being
unable to account for the other party’s perspective
seems puzzling because people slip in and out of
these roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple
times in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the
extensive experience that people have as both givers
and receivers, they often struggle to transfer
information gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)
and apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as
a receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize
information about their own preferences and
experiences in order to produce more efficient
outcomes in their exchange relations. In practical
terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on
gifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift
expenditures according to personal insight.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Which statement best characterizes the relationship between Sempere and Charles Dickens?
A) Sempere models his own writing after Dickens’s style.

Passage 1 is adapted from Nicholas Carr, “Author
Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains.”
©2010 by Condé Nast. Passage 2 is from Steven Pinker,
“Mind over Mass Media.” ©2010 by The New York Times

Passage 1
    The mental consequences of our online
info-crunching are not universally bad.
Certain cognitive skills are strengthened by our use
of computers and the Net. These tend to involve
more primitive mental functions, such as hand-eye
coordination, reflex response, and the processing of
visual cues. One much-cited study of video gaming
revealed that after just 10 days of playing action
games on computers, a group of young people had
significantly boosted the speed with which they could
shift their visual focus between various images and
tasks.
     It’s likely that Web browsing also strengthens
brain functions related to fast-paced problem
solving, particularly when it requires spotting
patterns in a welter of data. A British study of the
way women search for medical information online
indicated that an experienced Internet user can, at
least in some cases, assess the trustworthiness and
probable value of a Web page in a matter of seconds.
The more we practice surfing and scanning, the more
adept our brain becomes at those tasks.
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly
at such benefits and conclude that the Web is making
us smarter. In a Science article published in early
2009, prominent developmental psychologist Patricia
Greenfield reviewed more than 40 studies of the
effects of various types of media on intelligence and
learning ability. She concluded that “every medium
develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.

The author of Passage 1 indicates which of the following about the use of screen-based technologies?

This passage is adapted from John Bohannon, “Why You
Shouldn’t Trust Internet Comments.” ©2013 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

    The “wisdom of crowds” has become a mantra of
the Internet age. Need to choose a new vacuum
cleaner? Check out the reviews on online merchant
Amazon. But a new study suggests that such online
scores don’t always reveal the best choice. A massive
controlled experiment of Web users finds that such
ratings are highly susceptible to irrational “herd
behavior”—and that the herd can be manipulated.
Sometimes the crowd really is wiser than you. The
classic examples are guessing the weight of a bull or
the number of gumballs in a jar. Your guess is
probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the
average of many people’s choices is remarkably close
to the true number.
    But what happens when the goal is to judge
something less tangible, such as the quality or worth
of a product? According to one theory, the wisdom
of the crowd still holds—measuring the aggregate of
people’s opinions produces a stable, reliable
value. Skeptics, however, argue that people’s
opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So
nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary
opinions—for example, exposing them to some very
good or very bad attitudes—will steer the crowd in a
different direction. To test which hypothesis is true,
you would need to manipulate huge numbers of
people, exposing them to false information and
determining how it affects their opinions.
    A team led by Sinan Aral, a network scientist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, did exactly that. Aral has been secretly
working with a popular website that aggregates news
stories. The website allows users to make comments
about news stories and vote each other’s comments
up or down. The vote tallies are visible as a number
next to each comment, and the position of the
comments is chronological. (Stories on the site get an
average of about ten comments and about three votes
per comment.) It’s a follow-up to his experiment
using people’s ratings of movies to measure how
much individual people influence each other online
(answer: a lot). This time, he wanted to know how
much the crowd influences the individual, and
whether it can be controlled from outside.
    For five months, every comment submitted by a
user randomly received an “up” vote (positive); a
“down” vote (negative); or as a control, no vote at all.
The team then observed how users rated those
comments. The users generated more than
100,000 comments that were viewed more than
10 million times and rated more than 300,000 times
by other users.
    At least when it comes to comments on news
sites, the crowd is more herdlike than wise.
Comments that received fake positive votes from the
researchers were 32% more likely to receive more
positive votes compared with a control, the team
reports. And those comments were no more likely
than the control to be down-voted by the next viewer
to see them. By the end of the study, positively
manipulated comments got an overall boost of about
25%. However, the same did not hold true for
negative manipulation. The ratings of comments that
got a fake down vote were usually negated by an up
vote by the next user to see them.
    “Our experiment does not reveal the psychology
behind people’s decisions,” Aral says, “but an
intuitive explanation is that people are more
skeptical of negative social influence. They’re more
willing to go along with positive opinions from other
people.”
    Duncan Watts, a network scientist at Microsoft
Research in New York City, agrees with that
conclusion. “[But] one question is whether the
positive [herding] bias is specific to this site” or true
in general, Watts says. He points out that the
category of the news items in the experiment had a
strong effect on how much people could be
manipulated. “I would have thought that ‘business’ is
pretty similar to ‘economics,’ yet they find a much
stronger effect (almost 50% stronger) for the former
than the latter. What explains this difference? If we’re
going to apply these findings in the real world, we’ll
need to know the answers.”
    Will companies be able to boost their products by
manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?
“That is easier said than done,” Watts says. If people
detect—or learn—that comments on a website are
being manipulated, the herd may spook and leave
entirely.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted
incline running, and went on to document it in a
wide range of species. It not only allowed young
birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few
weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient
alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments,
adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper
than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and
onto the ceiling.
    In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on
surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop,
the Dials came up with a viable origin for the
flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding
animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the
tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for
half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the
ground-up hypothesis).

qThis passage is adapted from Carolyn Gramling, “Source of
Mysterious Medieval Eruption Identified.” ©2013 by
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

    About 750 years ago, a powerful volcano erupted
somewhere on Earth, kicking off a centuries-long
cold snap known as the Little Ice Age. Identifying the
volcano responsible has been tricky.
    That a powerful volcano erupted somewhere in
the world, sometime in the Middle Ages, is written in
polar ice cores in the form of layers of sulfate
deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass. These
cores suggest that the amount of sulfur the mystery
volcano sent into the stratosphere put it firmly
among the ranks of the strongest climate-perturbing
eruptions of the current geological epoch, the
Holocene, a period that stretches from 10,000 years
ago to the present. A haze of stratospheric sulfur
cools the climate by reflecting solar energy back into
space.
    In 2012, a team of scientists led by geochemist
Gifford Miller strengthened the link between the
mystery eruption and the onset of the Little Ice Age
by using radiocarbon dating of dead plant material
from beneath the ice caps on Baffin Island and
Iceland, as well as ice and sediment core data, to
determine that the cold summers and ice growth
began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 C.E. (and
became intensified between 1430 and 1455 C.E.).
Such a sudden onset pointed to a huge volcanic
eruption injecting sulfur into the stratosphere and
starting the cooling. Subsequent, unusually large and
frequent eruptions of other volcanoes, as well as
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks persisting long after the
aerosols have been removed from the atmosphere,
may have prolonged the cooling through the 1700s.
    Volcanologist Franck Lavigne and colleagues now
think they’ve identified the volcano in question:
Indonesia’s Samalas. One line of evidence, they note,
is historical records. According to Babad Lombok,
records of the island written on palm leaves in Old
Javanese, Samalas erupted catastrophically before the
end of the 13th century, devastating surrounding
villages—including Lombok’s capital at the time,
Pamatan—with ash and fast-moving sweeps of hot
rock and gas called pyroclastic flows.
    The researchers then began to reconstruct the
formation of the large, 800-meter-deep caldera [a
basin-shaped volcanic crater] that now sits atop the
volcano. They examined 130 outcrops on the flanks
of the volcano, exposing sequences of pumice—ash
hardened into rock—and other pyroclastic material.
The volume of ash deposited, and the estimated
height of the eruption plume (43 kilometers above
sea level) put the eruption’s magnitude at a
minimum of 7 on the volcanic explosivity index
(which has a scale of 1 to 8)—making it one of the
largest known in the Holocene.
    The team also performed radiocarbon analyses on
carbonized tree trunks and branches buried within
the pyroclastic deposits to confirm the date of the
eruption; it could not, they concluded, have
happened before 1257 C.E., and certainly happened
in the 13th century.
    It’s not a total surprise that an Indonesian volcano
might be the source of the eruption, Miller says. “An
equatorial eruption is more consistent with the
apparent climate impacts.” And, he adds, with sulfate
appearing in both polar ice caps—Arctic and
Antarctic—there is “a strong consensus” that this
also supports an equatorial source.
    Another possible candidate—both in terms of
timing and geographical location—is Ecuador’s
Quilotoa, estimated to have last erupted between
1147 and 1320 C.E. But when Lavigne’s team
examined shards of volcanic glass from this volcano,
they found that they didn’t match the chemical
composition of the glass found in polar ice cores,
whereas the Samalas glass is a much closer match.
That, they suggest, further strengthens the case that
Samalas was responsible for the medieval “year
without summer” in 1258 C.E.



Question 49:
Which choice best supports the claim that Quilotoa was not responsible for the Little Ice Age?
A) Lines 3-4 (“Identifying... tricky”)
B) Lines 26-28 (“Sucha... cooling”)

This passage is adapted from David Owen, The Conundrum:
How Scientific Innovation, Increased Efficiency, and Good
Intentions Can Make Our Energy and Climate Problems Worse.
©2011 by David Owen.

    Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
Line prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
    One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control
measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
    Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
    One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.

The narrator uses the phrase “making trial of everything” (line 7) to present Eppie as
A) friendly.
B) curious.

qThis passage is adapted from Carolyn Gramling, “Source of
Mysterious Medieval Eruption Identified.” ©2013 by
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

    About 750 years ago, a powerful volcano erupted
somewhere on Earth, kicking off a centuries-long
cold snap known as the Little Ice Age. Identifying the
volcano responsible has been tricky.
    That a powerful volcano erupted somewhere in
the world, sometime in the Middle Ages, is written in
polar ice cores in the form of layers of sulfate
deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass. These
cores suggest that the amount of sulfur the mystery
volcano sent into the stratosphere put it firmly
among the ranks of the strongest climate-perturbing
eruptions of the current geological epoch, the
Holocene, a period that stretches from 10,000 years
ago to the present. A haze of stratospheric sulfur
cools the climate by reflecting solar energy back into
space.
    In 2012, a team of scientists led by geochemist
Gifford Miller strengthened the link between the
mystery eruption and the onset of the Little Ice Age
by using radiocarbon dating of dead plant material
from beneath the ice caps on Baffin Island and
Iceland, as well as ice and sediment core data, to
determine that the cold summers and ice growth
began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 C.E. (and
became intensified between 1430 and 1455 C.E.).
Such a sudden onset pointed to a huge volcanic
eruption injecting sulfur into the stratosphere and
starting the cooling. Subsequent, unusually large and
frequent eruptions of other volcanoes, as well as
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks persisting long after the
aerosols have been removed from the atmosphere,
may have prolonged the cooling through the 1700s.
    Volcanologist Franck Lavigne and colleagues now
think they’ve identified the volcano in question:
Indonesia’s Samalas. One line of evidence, they note,
is historical records. According to Babad Lombok,
records of the island written on palm leaves in Old
Javanese, Samalas erupted catastrophically before the
end of the 13th century, devastating surrounding
villages—including Lombok’s capital at the time,
Pamatan—with ash and fast-moving sweeps of hot
rock and gas called pyroclastic flows.
    The researchers then began to reconstruct the
formation of the large, 800-meter-deep caldera [a
basin-shaped volcanic crater] that now sits atop the
volcano. They examined 130 outcrops on the flanks
of the volcano, exposing sequences of pumice—ash
hardened into rock—and other pyroclastic material.
The volume of ash deposited, and the estimated
height of the eruption plume (43 kilometers above
sea level) put the eruption’s magnitude at a
minimum of 7 on the volcanic explosivity index
(which has a scale of 1 to 8)—making it one of the
largest known in the Holocene.
    The team also performed radiocarbon analyses on
carbonized tree trunks and branches buried within
the pyroclastic deposits to confirm the date of the
eruption; it could not, they concluded, have
happened before 1257 C.E., and certainly happened
in the 13th century.
    It’s not a total surprise that an Indonesian volcano
might be the source of the eruption, Miller says. “An
equatorial eruption is more consistent with the
apparent climate impacts.” And, he adds, with sulfate
appearing in both polar ice caps—Arctic and
Antarctic—there is “a strong consensus” that this
also supports an equatorial source.
    Another possible candidate—both in terms of
timing and geographical location—is Ecuador’s
Quilotoa, estimated to have last erupted between
1147 and 1320 C.E. But when Lavigne’s team
examined shards of volcanic glass from this volcano,
they found that they didn’t match the chemical
composition of the glass found in polar ice cores,
whereas the Samalas glass is a much closer match.
That, they suggest, further strengthens the case that
Samalas was responsible for the medieval “year
without summer” in 1258 C.E.



Question 42:
The main purpose of the passage is to
A) describe periods in Earth’s recent geologic history.
B) explain the methods scientists use in radiocarbon analysis.
C) describe evidence linking the volcano Samalas to the Little Ice Age.
D) explain how volcanic glass forms during volcanic eruptions.

This passage is adapted from Peter A. Ensminger, Life Under
the Sun. ©2001 by Peter A. Ensminger.

    Many millennia before the invention of
herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to
control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a
Line valuable part of an integrated weed-management
program. Although plowing kills standing weeds,
farmers have long known that it often leads to the
emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.
    Ecologists have shown that a farmer’s field can
have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter
buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists
have shown that seeds buried more than about one
centimeter below the soil surface do not receive
enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow,
which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil
surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the
surface where their germination is induced by
exposure to sunlight?
    Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn
Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a
relatively simple experiment, they went to ten
different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and
collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the
soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred
up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then
exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a
greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples,
weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in
light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives
weed seeds a “light break,” and this stimulates their
germination.
    More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen
University in Germany reasoned that when farmers
plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed
seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is
turned over, and that this stimulates their
germination. Although the light exposures from
plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can
be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the
germination of weed seeds would be minimized if
farmers simply plowed their fields during the night,
when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which
photons hit the surface] is below 10^15 photons per
square meter per second. Although even under these
conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike
each square millimeter of ground each second, this
illumination is below the threshold needed to
stimulate the germination of most seeds.
    Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when
he first came up with this idea because he assumed
that such a simple method of weed control as
plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would
have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent
experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific
meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated
that the method can be effective.
    Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two
agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated
threefold, at around midday and the other strip
at night. No crops were planted in these pilot
experiments, to avoid possible competition with
the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic.
More than 80 percent of the surface of the field
plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas
only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was
covered by weeds.
    This method of weed control is currently being
used by several farmers in Germany. Because many
of the same weed species that invade farmers’ fields
in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world,
this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact,
recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon,
Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina
support this idea.

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

This passage is adapted from MacDonald Harris,
The Balloonist. ©2011 by The Estate of Donald Heiney.
During the summer of 1897, the narrator of this story, a
fictional Swedish scientist, has set out for the North Pole
in a hydrogen-powered balloon.

    My emotions are complicated and not
readily verifiable. I feel a vast yearning that is
simultaneously a pleasure and a pain. I am certain
of the consummation of this yearning, but I don’t
know yet what form it will take, since I do not
understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.
For the first time there is borne in upon me the full
truth of what I myself said to the doctor only an hour
ago: that my motives in this undertaking are not
entirely clear. For years, for a lifetime, the machinery
of my destiny has worked in secret to prepare for this
moment; its clockwork has moved exactly toward
this time and place and no other. Rising slowly from
the earth that bore me and gave me sustenance, I am
carried helplessly toward an uninhabited and hostile,
or at best indifferent, part of the earth, littered with
the bones of explorers and the wrecks of ships, frozen
supply caches, messages scrawled with chilled fingers
and hidden in cairns that no eye will ever see.
Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have
died. Yet in freely willing this enterprise, in choosing
this moment and no other when the south wind
will carry me exactly northward at a velocity of
eight knots, I have converted the machinery of my
fate into the servant of my will. All this I understand,
as I understand each detail of the technique by which
this is carried out. What I don’t understand is why I
am so intent on going to this particular place. Who
wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat
it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like
a railway? The Danish ministers have declared from
their pulpits that participation in polar expeditions is
beneficial to the soul’s eternal well-being, or so I read
in a newspaper. It isn’t clear how this doctrine is to
be interpreted, except that the Pole is something
difficult or impossible to attain which must
nevertheless be sought for, because man is
condemned to seek out and know everything
whether or not the knowledge gives him pleasure. In
short, it is the same unthinking lust for knowledge
that drove our First Parents out of the garden.
    And suppose you were to find it in spite of all, this
wonderful place that everybody is so anxious to stand
on! What would you find? Exactly nothing.
A point precisely identical to all the others in a
completely featureless wasteland stretching around it
for hundreds of miles. It is an abstraction, a
mathematical fiction. No one but a Swedish madman
could take the slightest interest in it. Here I am. The
wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily
northward at the speed of a trotting dog. Behind us,
perhaps forever, lie the Cities of Men with their
teacups and their brass bedsteads. I am going forth of
my own volition to join the ghosts of Bering and
poor Franklin, of frozen De Long and his men.
What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not
an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself. The
doctor was right, even though I dislike him.
Fundamentally I am a dangerous madman, and what
I do is both a challenge to my egotism and a
surrender to it.

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is
adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....

yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be
useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the
Texas gourd study.



Question 27:
What did Theis and Adler do as part of their study that most directly allowed Theis to reason that “bees were repelled not by the fragrance itself” (lines 70-71)?
A) They observed the behavior of bees and beetles both before and after the flowers opened in the morning.
B) They increased the presence of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene only during the August flowering season.
C) They compared the gourds that developed from naturally pollinated flowers to the gourds that developed from hand-pollinated flowers.
D) They gave bees a chance to choose between beetle-free enhanced flowers and beetle-free normal flowers.

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is
adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....
    Consider, sir, dispassionately, these
observations—for a glimpse of this truth seemed to
open before you when you observed, “that to see one
half of the human race excluded by the other from all
participation of government, was a political
phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?

This passage is adapted from Jeffrey Mervis, “Why Null
Results Rarely See the Light of Day.” ©2014 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.


    The question of what to do with null
results—when researchers fail to see an effect that
should be detectable—has long been hotly debated
among those conducting medical trials, where the
results can have a big impact on lives and corporate
bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to
the social and behavioral sciences, which also have
the potential to sway public and social policy.
There were little hard data, however, on how often or
why null results were squelched. “Yes, it’s true that
null results are not as exciting,” political scientist
Gary King of Harvard University says. “But I suspect
another reason they are rarely published is that there
are many, many ways to produce null results by
messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.”
    In a recent study, Stanford political economist
Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students
examined every study since 2002 that was funded by
a competitive grants program called TESS
(Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences).
TESS allows scientists to order up Internet-based
surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test
a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters
tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal
dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus
on policy matters).
    Malhotra’s team tracked down working papers
from most of the experiments that weren’t published,
and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to
their results. In their e-mailed responses, some
scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more
pressing matters—but many also believed the
journals just wouldn’t be interested. “The
unfortunate reality of the publishing world [is] that
null effects do not tell a clear story,” said one
scientist. Said another, “Never published, definitely
disappointed to not see any major effects.”
    Their answers suggest to Malhotra that rescuing
findings from the file drawer will require a shift in
expectations. “What needs to change is the
culture—the author’s belief about what will happen if
the research is written up,” he says.
    Not unexpectedly, the statistical strength of the
findings made a huge difference in whether they
were ever published. Overall, 42% of the experiments
produced statistically significant results. Of those,
62% were ultimately published, compared with 21%
of the null results. However, the Stanford team was
surprised that researchers didn’t even write up
65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.
    Scientists not involved in the study praise its
“clever” design. “It’s a very important paper” that
“starts to put numbers on things we want to
understand,” says economist Edward Miguel of the
University of California, Berkeley.
    He and others note that the bias against null
studies can waste time and money when researchers
devise new studies replicating strategies already
found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish
significant results from similar experiments in the
future, they could look stronger than they should
because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even
more troubling to Malhotra was the fact that two
scientists whose initial studies “didn’t work out”
went on to publish results based on a smaller sample.
“The non-TESS version of the same study, in which
we used a student sample, did yield fruit,” noted one
investigator.
    A registry for data generated by all experiments
would address these problems, the authors argue.
They say it should also include a “preanalysis” plan,
that is, a detailed description of what the scientist
hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed.
Such plans would help deter researchers from
tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in
search of more publishable results.



Question 14:
The passage indicates that a problem with failing to document null results is that
A) the results of related studies will be misleading.
B) researchers may overlook promising areas of study.
C) mistakes in the collection of null results may be overlooked.
D) the bias against null results will be disregarded.

This passage is adapted from Brian Greene, “How the Higgs
Boson Was Found.” ©2013 by Smithsonian Institution. The
Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the
Higgs field. Experiments conducted in 2012–2013
tentatively confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and
thus of the Higgs field.

    Nearly a half-century ago, Peter Higgs and a
handful of other physicists were trying to understand
the origin of a basic physical feature: mass. You can
think of mass as an object’s heft or, a little more
precisely, as the resistance it offers to having its
motion changed. Push on a freight train (or a
feather) to increase its speed, and the resistance you
feel reflects its mass. At a microscopic level, the
freight train’s mass comes from its constituent
molecules and atoms, which are themselves built
from fundamental particles, electrons and quarks.
But where do the masses of these and other
fundamental particles come from?
    When physicists in the 1960s modeled the
behavior of these particles using equations rooted in
quantum physics, they encountered a puzzle. If they
imagined that the particles were all massless, then
each term in the equations clicked into a perfectly
symmetric pattern, like the tips of a perfect
snowflake. And this symmetry was not just
mathematically elegant. It explained patterns evident
in the experimental data. But—and here’s the
puzzle—physicists knew that the particles did have
mass, and when they modified the equations to
account for this fact, the mathematical harmony was
spoiled. The equations became complex and
unwieldy and, worse still, inconsistent.
    What to do? Here’s the idea put forward by Higgs.
Don’t shove the particles’ masses down the throat of
the beautiful equations. Instead, keep the equations
pristine and symmetric, but consider them operating
within a peculiar environment. Imagine that all of
space is uniformly filled with an invisible
substance—now called the Higgs field—that exerts a
drag force on particles when they accelerate through
it. Push on a fundamental particle in an effort to
increase its speed and, according to Higgs, you would
feel this drag force as a resistance. Justifiably, you
would interpret the resistance as the particle’s mass.
For a mental toehold, think of a ping-pong ball
submerged in water. When you push on the
ping-pong ball, it will feel much more massive than it
does outside of water. Its interaction with the watery
environment has the effect of endowing it with mass.
So with particles submerged in the Higgs field.
    In 1964, Higgs submitted a paper to a prominent
physics journal in which he formulated this idea
mathematically. The paper was rejected. Not because
it contained a technical error, but because the
premise of an invisible something permeating space,
interacting with particles to provide their mass, well,
it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought
speculation. The editors of the journal deemed it “of
no obvious relevance to physics.”
    But Higgs persevered (and his revised paper
appeared later that year in another journal), and
physicists who took the time to study the proposal
gradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius,
one that allowed them to have their cake and eat it
too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations
can retain their pristine form because the dirty work
of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the
environment.
    While I wasn’t around to witness the initial
rejection of Higgs’s proposal in 1964 (well, I was
around, but only barely), I can attest that by the
mid-1980s, the assessment had changed. The physics
community had, for the most part, fully bought into
the idea that there was a Higgs field permeating
space. In fact, in a graduate course I took that
covered what’s known as the Standard Model of
Particle Physics (the quantum equations physicists
have assembled to describe the particles of matter
and the dominant forces by which they influence
each other), the professor presented the Higgs field
with such certainty that for a long while I had no idea
it had yet to be established experimentally.
On occasion, that happens in physics. Mathematical
equations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale,
they can seemingly radiate reality so strongly, that
they become entrenched in the vernacular of
working physicists, even before there’s data to
confirm them.



Question 46:
The author notes that one reason Higgs’s theory gained acceptance was that it
A) let scientists accept two conditions that had previously seemed irreconcilable.
B) introduced an innovative approach that could be applied to additional problems.
C) answered a question that earlier scientists had not even raised.
D) explained why two distinct phenomena were being misinterpreted as one phenomenon.

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.

The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters
A) neglects to spend any time with his family members.
B) behaves as if he is a younger version of himself.
C) is very conscious of symbols of wealth and power.

This passage is adapted from Taras Grescoe, Straphanger:
Saving Our Cities and Ourselves from the Automobile. ©2012
by Taras Grescoe.

    Though there are 600 million cars on the planet,
and counting, there are also seven billion people,
which means that for the vast majority of us getting
around involves taking buses, ferryboats, commuter
trains, streetcars, and subways. In other words,
traveling to work, school, or the market means being
a straphanger: somebody who, by choice or necessity,
relies on public transport, rather than a privately
owned automobile.
    Half the population of New York, Toronto, and
London do not own cars. Public transport is how
most of the people of Asia and Africa, the world’s
most populous continents, travel. Every day, subway
systems carry 155 million passengers, thirty-four
times the number carried by all the world’s airplanes,
and the global public transport market is now valued
at $428 billion annually. A century and a half after
the invention of the internal combustion engine,
private car ownership is still an anomaly.
    And yet public transportation, in many minds, is
the opposite of glamour—a squalid last resort for
those with one too many impaired driving charges,
too poor to afford insurance, or too decrepit to get
behind the wheel of a car. In much of North
America, they are right: taking transit is a depressing
experience. Anybody who has waited far too long on
a street corner for the privilege of boarding a
lurching, overcrowded bus, or wrestled luggage onto
subways and shuttles to get to a big city airport,
knows that transit on this continent tends to be
underfunded, ill-maintained, and ill-planned. Given
the opportunity, who wouldn’t drive? Hopping in a
car almost always gets you to your destination more
quickly.
    It doesn’t have to be like this. Done right, public
transport can be faster, more comfortable, and
cheaper than the private automobile. In Shanghai,
German-made magnetic levitation trains skim over
elevated tracks at 266 miles an hour, whisking people
to the airport at a third of the speed of sound. In
provincial French towns, electric-powered streetcars
run silently on rubber tires, sliding through narrow
streets along a single guide rail set into cobblestones.
From Spain to Sweden, Wi-Fi equipped high-speed
trains seamlessly connect with highly ramified metro
networks, allowing commuters to work on laptops as
they prepare for same-day meetings in once distant
capital cities. In Latin America, China, and India,
working people board fast-loading buses that move
like subway trains along dedicated busways, leaving
the sedans and SUVs of the rich mired in
dawn-to-dusk traffic jams. And some cities have
transformed their streets into cycle-path freeways,
making giant strides in public health and safety and
the sheer livability of their neighborhoods—in the
process turning the workaday bicycle into a viable
form of mass transit.
    If you credit the demographers, this transit trend
has legs. The “Millenials,” who reached adulthood
around the turn of the century and now outnumber
baby boomers, tend to favor cities over suburbs, and
are far more willing than their parents to ride buses
and subways. Part of the reason is their ease with
iPads, MP3 players, Kindles, and smartphones: you
can get some serious texting done when you’re not
driving, and earbuds offer effective insulation from
all but the most extreme commuting annoyances.
Even though there are more teenagers in the country
than ever, only ten million have a driver’s license
(versus twelve million a generation ago). Baby
boomers may have been raised in Leave It to Beaver
suburbs, but as they retire, a significant contingent is
favoring older cities and compact towns where they
have the option of walking and riding bikes. Seniors,
too, are more likely to use transit, and by 2025, there
will be 64 million Americans over the age of
sixty-five. Already, dwellings in older neighborhoods
in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Denver, especially
those near light-rail or subway stations, are
commanding enormous price premiums over
suburban homes. The experience of European and
Asian cities shows that if you make buses, subways,
and trains convenient, comfortable, fast, and safe, a
surprisingly large percentage of citizens will opt to
ride rather than drive.

This passage is adapted from Peter A. Ensminger, Life Under
the Sun. ©2001 by Peter A. Ensminger.

    Many millennia before the invention of
herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to
control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a
Line valuable part of an integrated weed-management
program. Although plowing kills standing weeds,
farmers have long known that it often leads to the
emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.
    Ecologists have shown that a farmer’s field can
have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter
buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists
have shown that seeds buried more than about one
centimeter below the soil surface do not receive
enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow,
which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil
surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the
surface where their germination is induced by
exposure to sunlight?
    Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn
Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a
relatively simple experiment, they went to ten
different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and
collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the
soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred
up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then
exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a
greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples,
weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in
light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives
weed seeds a “light break,” and this stimulates their
germination.
    More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen
University in Germany reasoned that when farmers
plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed
seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is
turned over, and that this stimulates their
germination. Although the light exposures from
plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can
be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the
germination of weed seeds would be minimized if
farmers simply plowed their fields during the night,
when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which
photons hit the surface] is below 10^15 photons per
square meter per second. Although even under these
conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike
each square millimeter of ground each second, this
illumination is below the threshold needed to
stimulate the germination of most seeds.
    Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when
he first came up with this idea because he assumed
that such a simple method of weed control as
plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would
have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent
experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific
meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated
that the method can be effective.
    Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two
agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated
threefold, at around midday and the other strip
at night. No crops were planted in these pilot
experiments, to avoid possible competition with
the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic.
More than 80 percent of the surface of the field
plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas
only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was
covered by weeds.
    This method of weed control is currently being
used by several farmers in Germany. Because many
of the same weed species that invade farmers’ fields
in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world,
this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact,
recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon,
Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina
support this idea.

Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.

Passage 1
    I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
    There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
    It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold
that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

Passage 2
    As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated....
    . . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.
Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the
only way in which capacities can be proved,—by
trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best
faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere
beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that
whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of
mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those
faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only
in some few of the many modes in which others are
permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the
individual, and a detriment to society, which loses
what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way
of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the
qualities which are not permitted to be exercised
shall not exist.



Question 33:
In Passage 1, Tocqueville implies that treatment of men and women as identical in nature would have which consequence?
A) Neither sex would feel oppressed.
B) Both sexes would be greatly harmed.
C) Men would try to reclaim their lost authority.
D) Men and women would have privileges they do not need.

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.



Question 45:
Which question was Maguire’s study of mental athletes primarily intended to answer?
A) Does the act of memorization make use of different brain structures than does the act of navigation?
B) Do mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities?
C) Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
D) What is the relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes?

This passage is adapted from MacDonald Harris,
The Balloonist. ©2011 by The Estate of Donald Heiney.
During the summer of 1897, the narrator of this story, a
fictional Swedish scientist, has set out for the North Pole
in a hydrogen-powered balloon.

    My emotions are complicated and not
readily verifiable. I feel a vast yearning that is
simultaneously a pleasure and a pain. I am certain
of the consummation of this yearning, but I don’t
know yet what form it will take, since I do not
understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.
For the first time there is borne in upon me the full
truth of what I myself said to the doctor only an hour
ago: that my motives in this undertaking are not
entirely clear. For years, for a lifetime, the machinery
of my destiny has worked in secret to prepare for this
moment; its clockwork has moved exactly toward
this time and place and no other. Rising slowly from
the earth that bore me and gave me sustenance, I am
carried helplessly toward an uninhabited and hostile,
or at best indifferent, part of the earth, littered with
the bones of explorers and the wrecks of ships, frozen
supply caches, messages scrawled with chilled fingers
and hidden in cairns that no eye will ever see.
Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have
died. Yet in freely willing this enterprise, in choosing
this moment and no other when the south wind
will carry me exactly northward at a velocity of
eight knots, I have converted the machinery of my
fate into the servant of my will. All this I understand,
as I understand each detail of the technique by which
this is carried out. What I don’t understand is why I
am so intent on going to this particular place. Who
wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat
it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like
a railway? The Danish ministers have declared from
their pulpits that participation in polar expeditions is
beneficial to the soul’s eternal well-being, or so I read
in a newspaper. It isn’t clear how this doctrine is to
be interpreted, except that the Pole is something
difficult or impossible to attain which must
nevertheless be sought for, because man is
condemned to seek out and know everything
whether or not the knowledge gives him pleasure. In
short, it is the same unthinking lust for knowledge
that drove our First Parents out of the garden.
    And suppose you were to find it in spite of all, this
wonderful place that everybody is so anxious to stand
on! What would you find? Exactly nothing.
A point precisely identical to all the others in a
completely featureless wasteland stretching around it
for hundreds of miles. It is an abstraction, a
mathematical fiction. No one but a Swedish madman
could take the slightest interest in it. Here I am. The
wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily
northward at the speed of a trotting dog. Behind us,
perhaps forever, lie the Cities of Men with their
teacups and their brass bedsteads. I am going forth of
my own volition to join the ghosts of Bering and
poor Franklin, of frozen De Long and his men.
What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not
an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself. The
doctor was right, even though I dislike him.
Fundamentally I am a dangerous madman, and what
I do is both a challenge to my egotism and a
surrender to it.

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.

This passage is adapted from Stephen Coleman, Scott
Anthony, and David E. Morrison, “Public Trust in the News.”
©2009 by Stephen Coleman.

    The news is a form of public knowledge.
Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the
health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a
private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge
increases in value as it is shared by more people. The
date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;
the causes and consequences of an environmental
disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular
law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all
examples of public knowledge that people are
generally expected to know in order to be considered
informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or
private knowledge, which is generally left to
individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is
promoted even to those who might not think it
matters to them. In short, the circulation of public
knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded
as a public good which cannot be solely
demand-driven.
    The production, circulation, and reception
of public knowledge is a complex process. It is
generally accepted that public knowledge should
be authoritative, but there is not always
common agreement about what the public needs to
know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and
how authoritative reputations should be determined
and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The
Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely
regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative
agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied
the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of
authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the
opinions of others.” As part of the general process of
the transformation of authority whereby there has
been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional
sources of public knowledge, the demand has been
for all authority to make explicit the frames of value
which determine their decisions. Centres of news
production, as our focus groups show, have not been
exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps
some news journalists feel uneasy about this
renegotiation of their authority:
    Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the
    “most read” lists on their own and other websites
    to work out which stories matter to readers and
    viewers. And now the audience—which used to
    know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of
    journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our
    credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008).
    The result of democratising access to TV news
    could be political disengagement by the majority
    and a dumbing down through a popularity
    contest of stories (online news editor, 2007).
    Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,
they amount to more than straightforward
professional defensiveness. In their reference to an
audience “which used to know its place” and
conflation between democratisation and “dumbing
down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular
mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by
experts, immune from populist pressures; and
disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive
recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down
opportunities for popular involvement in the making
of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional
claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are
right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every
institutional level in contemporary society,
scepticism towards the epistemological authority of
expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed
by several of our focus group participants, that the
news media should be “informative rather than
authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to
“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their
slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient
information” from which “we would be able to form
opinions of our own.”
    At stake here are two distinct conceptions of
authority. The journalists we have quoted are
resistant to the democratisation of news:
the supremacy of the clickstream (according to
which editors raise or lower the profile of stories
according to the number of readers clicking on them
online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”
news; the demands of some audience members for
raw news rather than constructed narratives.

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.



Question 28:
The sentence in lines 43-45 (“But... mystifying”) serves mainly to
A) identify factors that Olausson had previously failed to consider.
B) propose a solution to a dilemma encountered by Olausson.
C) anticipate a potential criticism of Olausson by the reader.
D) show a problem from the perspective of Olausson’s team.

This passage is adapted from Virginia Woolf, Three Guineas.
©1938 by Harcourt, Inc. Here, Woolf considers the situation
of women in English society.

    Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames,
an admirable vantage ground for us to make a
survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden
with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other,
Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a
place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not
now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession—the procession of the sons of educated
men.
    There they go, our brothers who have been
educated at public schools and universities,
mounting those steps, passing in and out of those
doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine,
transacting business, making money. It is a solemn
sight always—a procession, like a caravanserai
crossing a desert. . . . But now, for the past twenty
years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a
photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of
time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic
appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that
makes a difference. We who have looked so long at
the pageant in books, or from a curtained window
watched educated men leaving the house at about
nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house
at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively
no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount
those steps, pass in and out of those doors,... make
money, administer justice. . . . We who now agitate
these humble pens may in another century or two
speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine
spirit—a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say
whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in
military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old
family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that
venerable object was never decorated with plumes of
white horsehair. You laugh—indeed the shadow of
the private house still makes those dresses look a
little queer. We have worn private clothes so
long. . . . But we have not come here to laugh, or to
talk of fashions—men’s and women’s. We are here,
on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions.
And they are very important questions; and we have
very little time in which to answer them. The
questions that we have to ask and to answer about
that procession during this moment of transition are
so important that they may well change the lives of
all men and women for ever. For we have to ask
ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don’t we? On what terms shall we join
that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the
procession of educated men? The moment is short; it
may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a
matter of a few months longer.... But, you will
object, you have no time to think; you have your
battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to
organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam.
As you know from your own experience, and there
are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men
have always done their thinking from hand to
mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought
while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the
cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our
brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on
thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think
we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while
we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations
and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think . . . in the
gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts;
let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals.
Let us never cease from thinking—what is this
“civilization” in which we find ourselves? What are
these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why
should we make money out of them? Where in
short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of
educated men?

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?



Question 41:
In the context of each passage as a whole, the questions in lines 25-27 of Passage 1 and lines 67-69 of Passage 2 primarily function to help each speaker
A) cast doubt on the other’s sincerity.

This passage is adapted from J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick,
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid.” ©1953 by Nature Publishing Group. Watson and Crick
deduced the structure of DNA using evidence from Rosalind
Franklin and R. G. Gosling’s X-ray crystallography diagrams
of DNA and from Erwin Chargaff’s data on the base
composition of DNA.

    The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a
very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a
regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.
To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which
can be of four different types. Two of the possible
bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the
other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.
So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the
chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of
phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.
    The first feature of our structure which is of
biological interest is that it consists not of one chain,
but of two. These two chains are both coiled around
a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that
since there was only one chain in the chemical
formula there would only be one in the structural
unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray
evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.
    The other biologically important feature is the
manner in which the two chains are held together.
This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases.
The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base
from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single
base from the other. The important point is that only
certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.
One member of a pair must be a purine and the other
a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two
chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for
example, there would not be room for it.
    We believe that the bases will be present almost
entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true,
the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are:
adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine.
Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but
when it does, its partner on the other chain must
always be thymine.
    The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is
completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of
bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a
long molecule many different permutations are
possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise
sequence of bases is the code which carries the
genetical information. If the actual order of the bases
on one of the pair of chains were given, one could
write down the exact order of the bases on the other
one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain
is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule might duplicate itself.

This passage is adapted from David Rotman, “How
Technology Is Destroying Jobs.” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    MIT business scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee have argued that impressive
advances in computer technology—from improved
industrial robotics to automated translation
services—are largely behind the sluggish
employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
more ominous for workers, they foresee dismal
prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful
new technologies are increasingly adopted not only
in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in
professions such as law, financial services, education,
and medicine.
    That robots, automation, and software can replace
people might seem obvious to anyone who’s worked
in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But
Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s claim is more troubling
and controversial. They believe that rapid
technological change has been destroying jobs faster
than it is creating them, contributing to the
stagnation of median income and the growth of
inequality in the United States. And, they suspect,
something similar is happening in other
technologically advanced countries.
    As evidence, Brynjolfsson and McAfee point to a
chart that only an economist could love. In
economics, productivity—the amount of economic
value created for a given unit of input, such as an
hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and
wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the
chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines
represent productivity and total employment in the
United States. For years after World War II, the
two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in
jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The
pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value
from their workers, the country as a whole became
richer, which fueled more economic activity and
created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the
lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,
but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a
significant gap appears between the two lines,
showing economic growth with no parallel increase
in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the
“great decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is
confident that technology is behind both the healthy
growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.
    It’s a startling assertion because it threatens the
faith that many economists place in technological
progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that
technology boosts productivity and makes societies
wealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark
side: technological progress is eliminating the need
for many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker
worse off than before. Brynjolfsson can point to a
second chart indicating that median income is failing
to rise even as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s
the great paradox of our era,” he says. “Productivity
is at record levels, innovation has never been faster,
and yet at the same time, we have a falling median
income and we have fewer jobs. People are falling
behind because technology is advancing so fast and
our skills and organizations aren’t keeping up.”
    While technological changes can be painful for
workers whose skills no longer match the needs of
employers, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist,
says that no historical pattern shows these shifts
leading to a net decrease in jobs over an extended
period. Katz has done extensive research on how
technological advances have affected jobs over the
last few centuries—describing, for example, how
highly skilled artisans in the mid-19th century were
displaced by lower-skilled workers in factories.
While it can take decades for workers to acquire the
expertise needed for new types of employment, he
says, “we never have run out of jobs. There is no
long-term trend of eliminating work for people. Over
the long term, employment rates are fairly
stable. People have always been able to create new
jobs. People come up with new things to do.”
    Still, Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is
something different about today’s digital
technologies—something that could affect an even
broader range of work. The question, he says, is
whether economic history will serve as a useful
guide. Will the job disruptions caused by technology
be temporary as the workforce adapts, or will we see
a science-fiction scenario in which automated
processes and robots with superhuman skills take
over a broad swath of human tasks? Though Katz
expects the historical pattern to hold, it is “genuinely
a question,” he says. “If technology disrupts enough,
who knows what will happen?”

This passage is adapted from Daniel Chamovitz, What a
Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses. ©2012 by
Daniel Chamovitz

    The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
    We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.



Question 48:
Which choice describes a scenario in which Hodick and Sievers’s model predicts that a Venus flytrap will NOT close around an insect?
A) A large insect’s second contact with the plant’s trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap’s threshold.
B) A large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably.
C) A large insect’s contact with the plant’s trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap.
D) A large insect’s contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”

The author uses the phrase “aerodynamic sweet spot” in line 63 most likely to
A) describe how the proper structural design of an airplane helps to save fuel.
B) show that flying can be an exhilarating experience.
C) describe the birds’ synchronized wing movement.

This passage is adapted from Daniyal Mueenuddin,
“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
    The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
    “What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”
    “Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
    “And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
    The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
    The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.



Question 10:
According to the passage, what does Nawab consider to be the best result of getting the motorcycle?
A) People start calling him “Uncle.”
B) He’s able to expand his business.
C) He’s able to educate his daughters.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Daughter. ©2001 by Amy Tan.

    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.

This passage is adapted from Mary Helen Stefaniak, The
Cailiffs of Baghdad, Georgia: A Novel. ©2010 by Mary Helen
Stefaniak.

    Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is
adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If

This passage is adapted from Bryan Walsh, “Whole Food
Blues: Why Organic Agriculture May Not Be So Sustainable.”
©2012 by Time Inc.

    When it comes to energy, everyone loves
efficiency. Cutting energy waste is one of those goals
that both sides of the political divide can agree on,
even if they sometimes diverge on how best to get
there. Energy efficiency allows us to get more out of
our given resources, which is good for the economy
and (mostly) good for the environment as well. In
an increasingly hot and crowded world, the only
sustainable way to live is to get more out of less.
Every environmentalist would agree.
    But change the conversation to food, and
suddenly efficiency doesn’t look so good.
Conventional industrial agriculture has become
incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis.
Thanks to fertilizers, mechanization and irrigation,
each American farmer feeds over 155 people
worldwide. Conventional farming gets more and
more crop per square foot of cultivated land—
over 170 bushels of corn per acre in Iowa, for
example—which can mean less territory needs to
be converted from wilderness to farmland.
And since a third of the planet is already used for
agriculture—destroying forests and other wild
habitats along the way—anything that could help us
produce more food on less land would seem to be
good for the environment.
    Of course, that’s not how most environmentalists
regard their arugula [a leafy green]. They have
embraced organic food as better for the planet—and
healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by
agricultural corporations. Environmentalists disdain
the enormous amounts of energy needed and waste
created by conventional farming, while organic
practices—forgoing artificial fertilizers and chemical
pesticides—are considered far more sustainable.
Sales of organic food rose 7.7% in 2010, up to $26.7
billion—and people are making those purchases for
their consciences as much as their taste buds.
    Yet a new meta-analysis in Nature does the math
and comes to a hard conclusion: organic farming
yields 25% fewer crops on average than conventional
agriculture. More land is therefore needed to
produce fewer crops—and that means organic
farming may not be as good for the planet as
we think.
    In the Nature analysis, scientists from McGill
University in Montreal and the University of
Minnesota performed an analysis of 66 studies
comparing conventional and organic methods across
34 different crop species, from fruits to grains to
legumes. They found that organic farming delivered
a lower yield for every crop type, though the disparity
varied widely. For rain-watered legume crops like
beans or perennial crops like fruit trees, organic
trailed conventional agriculture by just 5%. Yet for
major cereal crops like corn or wheat, as well as most
vegetables—all of which provide the bulk of the
world’s calories—conventional agriculture
outperformed organics by more than 25%.
    The main difference is nitrogen, the chemical key
to plant growth. Conventional agriculture makes use
of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each
year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant
growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the
compost or cover crops used in organic farming.
When we talk about a Green Revolution, we really
mean a nitrogen revolution—along with a lot
of water.
    But not all the nitrogen used in conventional
fertilizer ends up in crops—much of it ends up
running off the soil and into the oceans, creating vast
polluted dead zones. We’re already putting more
nitrogen into the soil than the planet can stand over
the long term. And conventional agriculture also
depends heavily on chemical pesticides, which can
have unintended side effects.
    What that means is that while conventional
agriculture is more efficient—sometimes much more
efficient—than organic farming, there are trade-offs
with each. So an ideal global agriculture system, in
the views of the study’s authors, may borrow the best
from both systems, as Jonathan Foley of the
University of Minnesota explained:
   The bottom line? Today’s organic farming
   practices are probably best deployed in fruit and
   vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not
   just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for
   delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple
   crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on,
   conventional farms have the advantage right
   now.
   Looking forward, I think we will need to deploy
   different kinds of practices (especially new,
   mixed approaches that take the best of organic
   and conventional farming systems) where they
   are best suited—geographically, economically,
   socially, etc.




Question 23:
According to the passage, a significant attribute of conventional agriculture is its ability to
A) produce a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.
B) maximize the output of cultivated land.
C) satisfy the dietary needs of the world’s population.
D) lessen the necessity of nitrogen in plant growth.

Passage 1 is adapted from a speech delivered in 1898 by
Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is
adapted from a speech delivered in 1900 by William
Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.



Question 36:
It can reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan considers the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule to be a
A) reaction to the excesses of imperial governments in the modern era.
B) sign that the belief in human equality is widespread.
C) testament to the effects of the foreign policy of the United States.
D) manifestation of an innate drive in humans toward self-rule.

This passage is adapted from Alan Ehrenhalt, The Great
Inversion and the Future of the American City. ©2013 by
Vintage. Ehrenhalt is an urbanologist—a scholar of cities
and their development. Demographic inversion is a
phenomenon that describes the rearrangement of living
patterns throughout a metropolitan area.

    We are not witnessing the abandonment of the
suburbs, or a movement of millions of people back to
the city all at once. The 2010 census certainly did not
turn up evidence of a middle-class stampede to the
nation’s cities. The news was mixed: Some of the
larger cities on the East Coast tended to gain
population, albeit in small increments. Those in the
Midwest, including Chicago, tended to lose
substantial numbers. The cities that showed gains in
overall population during the entire decade tended to
be in the South and Southwest. But when it comes to
measuring demographic inversion, raw census
numbers are an ineffective blunt instrument. A closer
look at the results shows that the most powerful
demographic events of the past decade were the
movement of African Americans out of central cities
(180,000 of them in Chicago alone) and the
settlement of immigrant groups in suburbs, often
ones many miles distant from downtown.
Central-city areas that gained affluent residents in
the first part of the decade maintained that
population in the recession years from 2007 to 2009.
They also, according to a 2011 study by Brookings,
suffered considerably less from increased
unemployment than the suburbs did. Not many
young professionals moved to new downtown
condos in the recession years because few such
residences were being built. But there is no reason to
believe that the demographic trends prevailing prior
to the construction bust will not resume once that
bust is over. It is important to remember that
demographic inversion is not a proxy for population
growth; it can occur in cities that are growing, those
whose numbers are flat, and even in those
undergoing a modest decline in size.
    America’s major cities face enormous fiscal
problems, many of them the result of public pension
obligations they incurred in the more prosperous
years of the past two decades. Some, Chicago
prominent among them, simply are not producing
enough revenue to support the level of public
services to which most of the citizens have grown to
feel entitled. How the cities are going to solve this
problem, I do not know. What I do know is that if
fiscal crisis were going to drive affluent professionals
out of central cities, it would have done so by now.
There is no evidence that it has.
    The truth is that we are living at a moment in
which the massive outward migration of the affluent
that characterized the second half of the
twentieth century is coming to an end. And we need
to adjust our perceptions of cities, suburbs, and
urban mobility as a result.
    Much of our perspective on the process of
metropolitan settlement dates, whether we realize it
or not, from a paper written in 1925 by the
University of Chicago sociologist Ernest W. Burgess.
It was Burgess who defined four urban/suburban
zones of settlement: a central business district; an
area of manufacturing just beyond it; then a
residential area inhabited by the industrial and
immigrant working class; and finally an outer
enclave of single-family dwellings.
    Burgess was right about the urban America of
1925; he was right about the urban America of 1974.
Virtually every city in the country had a downtown,
where the commercial life of the metropolis was
conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had
districts of working-class residences just beyond that;
and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the
upper middle class at the far end of the continuum.
As a family moved up the economic ladder, it also
moved outward from crowded working-class
districts to more spacious apartments and,
eventually, to a suburban home. The suburbs of
Burgess’s time bore little resemblance to those at the
end of the twentieth century, but the theory still
essentially worked. People moved ahead in life by
moving farther out.
    But in the past decade, in quite a few places, this
model has ceased to describe reality. There are still
downtown commercial districts, but there are no
factory districts lying next to them. There are
scarcely any factories at all. These close-in parts of
the city, whose few residents Burgess described as
dwelling in “submerged regions of poverty,
degradation and disease,” are increasingly the
preserve of the affluent who work in the commercial
core. And just as crucially newcomers to America are
not settling on the inside and accumulating the
resources to move out; they are living in the suburbs
from day one.



Question 11:
Which choice best summarizes the first paragraph of the passage (lines 1-35)?
A) The 2010 census demonstrated a sizeable growth in the number of middle-class families moving into inner cities.
B) The 2010 census is not a reliable instrument for measuring population trends in American cities.
C) Population growth and demographic inversion are distinct phenomena, and demographic inversion is evident in many American cities.
D) Population growth in American cities has been increasing since roughly 2000, while suburban populations have decreased.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted
incline running, and went on to document it in a
wide range of species. It not only allowed young
birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few
weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient
alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments,
adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper
than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and
onto the ceiling.
    In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on
surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop,
the Dials came up with a viable origin for the
flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding
animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the
tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for
half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the
ground-up hypothesis).

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is

Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....
    Consider, sir, dispassionately, these
observations—for a glimpse of this truth seemed to
open before you when you observed, “that to see one

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.



Question 52:
The questions in lines 74-78 primarily serve to
A) raise doubts about the reliability of the conclusions reached by Maguire.
B) emphasize and elaborate on an initially puzzling result of Maguire’s study of mental athletes.
C) imply that Maguire’s findings undermine earlier studies of the same phenomenon.
D) introduce and explain a connection between Maguire’s two studies and her earlier work.

Daughter. ©2001 by Amy Tan.

    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.

Passage 1 is adapted from Edmund Burke, Reflections on the
Revolution in France. Originally published in 1790. Passage 2
is adapted from Thomas Paine, Rights of Man. Originally
published in 1791.

Passage 1
    To avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and
versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of
obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have
consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions but with due
caution; that he should never dream of beginning its
reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of
a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By
this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him
into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their
poisonous weeds, and wild incantations, they may
regenerate the paternal constitution, and renovate
their father’s life.
    Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts
for objects of mere occasional interest may be
dissolved at pleasure—but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or
tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken
up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved
by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with
other reverence; because it is not a partnership in
things subservient only to the gross animal existence
of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a
partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
only between those who are living, but between those
who are living, those who are dead, and those who
are to be born. . . . The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at
their pleasure, and on their speculations of a
contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear
asunder the bands of their subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos of elementary principles.

Passage 2
    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is
the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who
are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each
other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagination
can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can
exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid
down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence,
and the other not in, and who never can meet in this
world, that the one should control the other to the
end of time?...
    The circumstances of the world are continually
changing, and the opinions of men change also; and
as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in
one age, may be thought wrong and found
inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to
decide, the living, or the dead?



Question 38:
Which choice best describes how Burke would most likely have reacted to Paine’s remarks in the final paragraph of Passage 2?
A) With approval, because adapting to new events may enhance existing partnerships.
B) With resignation, because changing circumstances are an inevitable aspect of life.
C) With skepticism, because Paine does not substantiate his claim with examples of governments changed for the better.
D) With disapproval, because changing conditions are insufficient justification for changing the form of government.

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!



Question 34:
How does Smith develop her argument about slavery as a “political question” (line 3) over the course of the passage?
A) She claims the designation is an outdated one and then offers alternative definitions.
B) She dismisses the designation as too narrow but then demonstrates its relevance to her audience.
C) She contends that the designation has become trite and then invites her audience to revitalize it.
D) She describes the meaning the designation has for men and then challenges women to embrace it.

Daughter. ©2001 by Amy Tan.

    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was

This passage is adapted from Mary Helen Stefaniak, The
Cailiffs of Baghdad, Georgia: A Novel. ©2010 by Mary Helen
Stefaniak.

    Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
Line blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
   Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the
Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
    It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
    They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
    Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
    What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a
string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
    Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
    “And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
    We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
    “She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
    Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”



Question 8:
According to the passage, Miss Spivey ended up in Threestep as a direct result of

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted
incline running, and went on to document it in a
wide range of species. It not only allowed young
birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few
weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient
alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments,
adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper
than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and
onto the ceiling.
    In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on
surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop,
the Dials came up with a viable origin for the
flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding
animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the
tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for
half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the
ground-up hypothesis).

Anthony, and David E. Morrison, “Public Trust in the News.”
©2009 by Stephen Coleman.

    The news is a form of public knowledge.
Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the
health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a
private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge
increases in value as it is shared by more people. The
date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;
the causes and consequences of an environmental
disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular
law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all
examples of public knowledge that people are
generally expected to know in order to be considered
informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or
private knowledge, which is generally left to
individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is
promoted even to those who might not think it
matters to them. In short, the circulation of public
knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded
as a public good which cannot be solely
demand-driven.
    The production, circulation, and reception
of public knowledge is a complex process. It is
generally accepted that public knowledge should
be authoritative, but there is not always
common agreement about what the public needs to
know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and
how authoritative reputations should be determined
and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The
Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely
regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative
agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied
the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of
authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the
opinions of others.” As part of the general process of
the transformation of authority whereby there has
been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional
sources of public knowledge, the demand has been
for all authority to make explicit the frames of value
which determine their decisions. Centres of news
production, as our focus groups show, have not been
exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps
some news journalists feel uneasy about this
renegotiation of their authority:
    Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the
    “most read” lists on their own and other websites
    to work out which stories matter to readers and
    viewers. And now the audience—which used to
    know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of
    journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our
    credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008).
    The result of democratising access to TV news
    could be political disengagement by the majority
    and a dumbing down through a popularity
    contest of stories (online news editor, 2007).
    Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,
they amount to more than straightforward
professional defensiveness. In their reference to an
audience “which used to know its place” and
conflation between democratisation and “dumbing
down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular
mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by
experts, immune from populist pressures; and
disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive
recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down
opportunities for popular involvement in the making
of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional
claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are
right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every
institutional level in contemporary society,
scepticism towards the epistemological authority of
expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed
by several of our focus group participants, that the
news media should be “informative rather than
authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to
“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their
slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient
information” from which “we would be able to form
opinions of our own.”
    At stake here are two distinct conceptions of
authority. The journalists we have quoted are
resistant to the democratisation of news:
the supremacy of the clickstream (according to
which editors raise or lower the profile of stories
according to the number of readers clicking on them
online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”
news; the demands of some audience members for
raw news rather than constructed narratives.

This passage is from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel’s Game.
©2008 by Dragonworks, S.L. Translation ©2009 by
Lucia Graves. The narrator, a writer, recalls his childhood in
early twentieth-century Barcelona.


    Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
    My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like
the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
    My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
    One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
    “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
    I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
    “A friend of yours?”
    “A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”
    That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.





Question 5:
It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the main reason that the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received is because
A) reading the book convinced him that he wanted to be a writer.
B) he’d only ever been given sweets and snacks as gifts in the past.
C) the gift meant that Sempere held him in high regard.
D) Sempere was a friend of the book’s author.

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is
adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....
    Consider, sir, dispassionately, these
observations—for a glimpse of this truth seemed to
open before you when you observed, “that to see one
half of the human race excluded by the other from all
participation of government, was a political
phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it
was impossible to explain.” If so, on what does your
constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will
bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by
a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same
test: though a different opinion prevails in this
country, built on the very arguments which you use
to justify the oppression of woman—prescription.
    Consider—I address you as a legislator—
whether, when men contend for their freedom, and
to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their
own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to
subjugate women, even though you firmly believe
that you are acting in the manner best calculated to
promote their happiness? Who made man the
exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift
of reason?
    In this style, argue tyrants of every
denomination, from the weak king to the weak
father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason;
yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be
useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force
all women, by denying them civil and political rights,
to remain immured in their families groping in
the dark?

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

This passage is adapted from David Owen, The Conundrum:
How Scientific Innovation, Increased Efficiency, and Good
Intentions Can Make Our Energy and Climate Problems Worse.
©2011 by David Owen.

    Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
Line prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
    One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control
measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
    Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
    One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

qThis passage is adapted from Carolyn Gramling, “Source of
Mysterious Medieval Eruption Identified.” ©2013 by
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

    About 750 years ago, a powerful volcano erupted
somewhere on Earth, kicking off a centuries-long
cold snap known as the Little Ice Age. Identifying the
volcano responsible has been tricky.
    That a powerful volcano erupted somewhere in
the world, sometime in the Middle Ages, is written in
polar ice cores in the form of layers of sulfate
deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass. These
cores suggest that the amount of sulfur the mystery
volcano sent into the stratosphere put it firmly
among the ranks of the strongest climate-perturbing
eruptions of the current geological epoch, the
Holocene, a period that stretches from 10,000 years
ago to the present. A haze of stratospheric sulfur
cools the climate by reflecting solar energy back into
space.
    In 2012, a team of scientists led by geochemist
Gifford Miller strengthened the link between the
mystery eruption and the onset of the Little Ice Age
by using radiocarbon dating of dead plant material
from beneath the ice caps on Baffin Island and
Iceland, as well as ice and sediment core data, to
determine that the cold summers and ice growth
began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 C.E. (and
became intensified between 1430 and 1455 C.E.).
Such a sudden onset pointed to a huge volcanic
eruption injecting sulfur into the stratosphere and
starting the cooling. Subsequent, unusually large and
frequent eruptions of other volcanoes, as well as
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks persisting long after the
aerosols have been removed from the atmosphere,
may have prolonged the cooling through the 1700s.
    Volcanologist Franck Lavigne and colleagues now
think they’ve identified the volcano in question:
Indonesia’s Samalas. One line of evidence, they note,
is historical records. According to Babad Lombok,
records of the island written on palm leaves in Old
Javanese, Samalas erupted catastrophically before the
end of the 13th century, devastating surrounding
villages—including Lombok’s capital at the time,
Pamatan—with ash and fast-moving sweeps of hot
rock and gas called pyroclastic flows.
    The researchers then began to reconstruct the
formation of the large, 800-meter-deep caldera [a
basin-shaped volcanic crater] that now sits atop the
volcano. They examined 130 outcrops on the flanks
of the volcano, exposing sequences of pumice—ash
hardened into rock—and other pyroclastic material.
The volume of ash deposited, and the estimated
height of the eruption plume (43 kilometers above
sea level) put the eruption’s magnitude at a
minimum of 7 on the volcanic explosivity index
(which has a scale of 1 to 8)—making it one of the
largest known in the Holocene.
    The team also performed radiocarbon analyses on
carbonized tree trunks and branches buried within
the pyroclastic deposits to confirm the date of the
eruption; it could not, they concluded, have
happened before 1257 C.E., and certainly happened
in the 13th century.
    It’s not a total surprise that an Indonesian volcano
might be the source of the eruption, Miller says. “An
equatorial eruption is more consistent with the
apparent climate impacts.” And, he adds, with sulfate
appearing in both polar ice caps—Arctic and
Antarctic—there is “a strong consensus” that this
also supports an equatorial source.
    Another possible candidate—both in terms of
timing and geographical location—is Ecuador’s
Quilotoa, estimated to have last erupted between
1147 and 1320 C.E. But when Lavigne’s team
examined shards of volcanic glass from this volcano,
they found that they didn’t match the chemical
composition of the glass found in polar ice cores,
whereas the Samalas glass is a much closer match.
That, they suggest, further strengthens the case that
Samalas was responsible for the medieval “year
without summer” in 1258 C.E.

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

This passage is adapted from Rachel Ehrenberg, “Salt
Stretches in Nanoworld.” ©2009 by Society for Science & the
Public. The “nanoworld” is the world observed on a scale
one billionth that of ordinary human experience.

    Inflexible old salt becomes a softy in the
nanoworld, stretching like taffy to more than twice
its length, researchers report. The findings may lead
to new approaches for making nanowires that could
end up in solar cells or electronic circuits. The work
also suggests that these ultra-tiny salt wires may
already exist in sea spray and large underground salt
deposits.
    “We think nanowires are special and go to great
lengths to make them,” says study coauthor
Nathan Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque. “Maybe they are more common than
we think.”
    Metals such as gold or lead, in which bonding
angles are loosey-goosey, can stretch out at
temperatures well below their melting points.
But scientists don’t expect this superplasticity in a
rigid, crystalline material like salt, Moore says.
    This unusual behavior highlights that different
forces rule the nanoworld, says theoretical physicist
Krzysztof Kempa of Boston College. “Forget about
gravity. It plays no role,” he says. Surface tension and
electrostatic forces are much more important at this
scale.
    Moore and his colleagues discovered salt’s
stretchiness accidently. They were investigating how
water sticks to a surface such as salt and created a
super-dry salt sample for testing. After cleaving a
chunk of salt about the size of a sugar cube with a
razor, the scientists guided a microscope that detects
forces toward the surface. When the tip was far away
there was no measured force, but within about seven
nanometers a very strong attraction rapidly
developed between the diamond tip of the
microscope and the salt. The salt actually stretched
out to glom on to the microscope tip. Using an
electron microscope to see what was happening, the
researchers observed the nanowires.
    The initial attraction between the tip and salt
might be due to electrostatic forces, perhaps good old
van der Waals interactions, the researchers
speculate. Several mechanisms might lead to the
elasticity, including the excessive surface tension
found in the nanoworld (the same tension that allows
a water strider to skim the surface of a pond).
    The surface tension is so strong that as the
microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt
stretches, Kempa says. “The inside has no choice but
to rearrange the atoms, rather than break,” he says.
    This bizarre behavior is actually mirrored in the
macroworld, the researchers say. Huge underground
deposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is
believed to play a role at these scales. Perhaps salty
nanowires are present in these deposits as well.
    “Sodium chloride is everywhere—in the air, in
our bodies,” Moore says. “This may change our view
of things, of what’s happening at the nanoscale.”
    The work also suggests new techniques for
making nanowires, which are often created through
nano-imprinting techniques, Kempa says. “We
invoke the intuition of the macroworld,” he says.
“Maybe instead of stamping [nanowires] we should
be nano-pulling them.”



Question 28:
Based on the passage, which choice best describes the relationship between salt behavior in the nanoworld and in the macroworld?
A) In both the nanoworld and the macroworld, salt can be flexible.
B) Salt flexibility is expected in the nanoworld but is surprising in the macroworld.
C) Salt nanowires were initially observed in the nanoworld and later observed in the macroworld.
D) In the nanoworld, salt’s interactions with water lead to very different properties than they do in the macroworld.

This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that
he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
    It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.

This passage is adapted from Jeffrey Mervis, “Why Null
Results Rarely See the Light of Day.” ©2014 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.


    The question of what to do with null
results—when researchers fail to see an effect that
should be detectable—has long been hotly debated
among those conducting medical trials, where the
results can have a big impact on lives and corporate
bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to
the social and behavioral sciences, which also have
the potential to sway public and social policy.
There were little hard data, however, on how often or
why null results were squelched. “Yes, it’s true that
null results are not as exciting,” political scientist
Gary King of Harvard University says. “But I suspect
another reason they are rarely published is that there
are many, many ways to produce null results by
messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.”
    In a recent study, Stanford political economist
Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students
examined every study since 2002 that was funded by
a competitive grants program called TESS
(Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences).
TESS allows scientists to order up Internet-based
surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test
a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters
tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal
dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus
on policy matters).
    Malhotra’s team tracked down working papers
from most of the experiments that weren’t published,
and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to
their results. In their e-mailed responses, some
scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more
pressing matters—but many also believed the
journals just wouldn’t be interested. “The
unfortunate reality of the publishing world [is] that
null effects do not tell a clear story,” said one
scientist. Said another, “Never published, definitely
disappointed to not see any major effects.”
    Their answers suggest to Malhotra that rescuing
findings from the file drawer will require a shift in
expectations. “What needs to change is the
culture—the author’s belief about what will happen if
the research is written up,” he says.
    Not unexpectedly, the statistical strength of the
findings made a huge difference in whether they
were ever published. Overall, 42% of the experiments
produced statistically significant results. Of those,
62% were ultimately published, compared with 21%
of the null results. However, the Stanford team was
surprised that researchers didn’t even write up
65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.
    Scientists not involved in the study praise its
“clever” design. “It’s a very important paper” that
“starts to put numbers on things we want to
understand,” says economist Edward Miguel of the
University of California, Berkeley.
    He and others note that the bias against null
studies can waste time and money when researchers
devise new studies replicating strategies already
found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish
significant results from similar experiments in the
future, they could look stronger than they should
because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even
more troubling to Malhotra was the fact that two
scientists whose initial studies “didn’t work out”
went on to publish results based on a smaller sample.
“The non-TESS version of the same study, in which
we used a student sample, did yield fruit,” noted one
investigator.
    A registry for data generated by all experiments
would address these problems, the authors argue.
They say it should also include a “preanalysis” plan,
that is, a detailed description of what the scientist
hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed.
Such plans would help deter researchers from
tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in
search of more publishable results.

This passage is from Charlotte Brontë, The Professor,
originally published in 1857.

    No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a
mistake in the choice of his profession, and every
man, worthy of the name, will row long against wind
and tide before he allows himself to cry out, “I am
baffled!” and submits to be floated passively back to
land. From the first week of my residence in X—
felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself—the
work of copying and translating business-letters—
was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been
all, I should long have borne with the nuisance; I am
not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the
double desire of getting my living and justifying to
myself and others the resolution I had taken to
become a tradesman, I should have endured in
silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I
should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I
longed for liberty; I should have pent in every sigh by
which my heart might have ventured to intimate its
distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and
joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire
for freer and fresher scenes; I should have set up the
image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my
small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two
should have been my household gods, from which
my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the
tender and the mighty, should never, either by
softness or strength, have severed me. But this was
not all; the antipathy which had sprung up between
myself and my employer striking deeper root and
spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from
every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to
feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the
slimy walls of a well.
    Antipathy is the only word which can express the
feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in
a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to
be excited by every, the most trifling movement,
look, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed
him; the degree of education evinced in my language
irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and
accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high
flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I
too should one day make a successful tradesman.
Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not
have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he
knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept
the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he
was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a
ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have
forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three
faculties—Caution, Tact, Observation; and prowling
and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never
baffle the lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels.
Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it
would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its
slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.
    I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was
returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul
with the pleasant feeling that the master who had
paid me grudged every penny of that hard‑earned
pittance—(I had long ceased to regard
Mr. Crimsworth as my brother—he was a hard,
grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable
tyrant: that was all). Thoughts, not varied but strong,
occupied my mind; two voices spoke within me;
again and again they uttered the same monotonous
phrases. One said: “William, your life is intolerable.”
The other: “What can you do to alter it?” I walked
fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January; as I
approached my lodgings, I turned from a general
view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to
whether my fire would be out; looking towards the
window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red
gleam.

This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.

    At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a
pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous,
and other ground birds ran along behind their
parents. “They jumped up like popcorn,” he said,
describing how they would flap their half-formed
wings and take short hops into the air. So when a
group of graduate students challenged him
to come up with new data on the age-old
ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project
to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds
learned to fly.
    Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a
model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local
rancher in Montana who was supplying him with
birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how
things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy
laboratory setup and explained how the birds’ first
hops and flights would be measured. The rancher
was incredulous. “He took one look and said, in
pretty colorful language, ‘What are those birds doing
on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give
them something to climb on!’ ” At first it seemed
unnatural—ground birds don’t like the ground? But
as he thought about it Ken realized that all the
species he’d watched in the wild preferred to rest on
ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where
they were safe from predators. They really only used
the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and
then left his son in charge of feeding and data
collection while he went away on a short work trip.
    Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial
was visibly upset when his father got back. “I asked
him how it went,” Ken recalled, “and he said,
‘Terrible! The birds are cheating!’ ” Instead of flying
up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using
their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them
run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the
while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that
was the “aha” moment. “The birds were using their
wings and legs cooperatively,” he told me, and that
single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
    Working together with Terry (who has since gone
on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a
series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as
they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing
angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began
to flap, but they angled their wings differently from
birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and
backward, using the force not for lift but to keep
their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. “It’s like
the spoiler on the back of a race car,” he explained,
which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing,
spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the
cars downward as they speed along, increasing
traction and handling. The birds were doing the very
same thing with their wings to help them scramble
up otherwise impossible slopes.
    Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted
incline running, and went on to document it in a
wide range of species. It not only allowed young
birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few
weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient
alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments,
adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper
than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and
onto the ceiling.
    In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on
surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop,
the Dials came up with a viable origin for the
flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding
animals don’t do and thus a shortcoming of the
tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for
half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the
ground-up hypothesis).

Which choice best reflects the overall sequence of events in the passage?
A) An experiment is proposed but proves unworkable; a less ambitious experiment is attempted, and it yields data that give rise to a new set of questions.

This passage is adapted from Brian Greene, “How the Higgs
Boson Was Found.” ©2013 by Smithsonian Institution. The
Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the
Higgs field. Experiments conducted in 2012–2013
tentatively confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and
thus of the Higgs field.

    Nearly a half-century ago, Peter Higgs and a
handful of other physicists were trying to understand
the origin of a basic physical feature: mass. You can
think of mass as an object’s heft or, a little more
precisely, as the resistance it offers to having its
motion changed. Push on a freight train (or a
feather) to increase its speed, and the resistance you
feel reflects its mass. At a microscopic level, the
freight train’s mass comes from its constituent
molecules and atoms, which are themselves built
from fundamental particles, electrons and quarks.
But where do the masses of these and other
fundamental particles come from?
    When physicists in the 1960s modeled the
behavior of these particles using equations rooted in
quantum physics, they encountered a puzzle. If they
imagined that the particles were all massless, then
each term in the equations clicked into a perfectly
symmetric pattern, like the tips of a perfect
snowflake. And this symmetry was not just
mathematically elegant. It explained patterns evident
in the experimental data. But—and here’s the
puzzle—physicists knew that the particles did have
mass, and when they modified the equations to
account for this fact, the mathematical harmony was
spoiled. The equations became complex and
unwieldy and, worse still, inconsistent.
    What to do? Here’s the idea put forward by Higgs.
Don’t shove the particles’ masses down the throat of
the beautiful equations. Instead, keep the equations
pristine and symmetric, but consider them operating
within a peculiar environment. Imagine that all of
space is uniformly filled with an invisible
substance—now called the Higgs field—that exerts a
drag force on particles when they accelerate through
it. Push on a fundamental particle in an effort to
increase its speed and, according to Higgs, you would
feel this drag force as a resistance. Justifiably, you
would interpret the resistance as the particle’s mass.
For a mental toehold, think of a ping-pong ball
submerged in water. When you push on the
ping-pong ball, it will feel much more massive than it
does outside of water. Its interaction with the watery
environment has the effect of endowing it with mass.
So with particles submerged in the Higgs field.
    In 1964, Higgs submitted a paper to a prominent
physics journal in which he formulated this idea
mathematically. The paper was rejected. Not because
it contained a technical error, but because the
premise of an invisible something permeating space,
interacting with particles to provide their mass, well,
it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought
speculation. The editors of the journal deemed it “of
no obvious relevance to physics.”
    But Higgs persevered (and his revised paper
appeared later that year in another journal), and
physicists who took the time to study the proposal
gradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius,
one that allowed them to have their cake and eat it
too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations
can retain their pristine form because the dirty work
of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the
environment.
    While I wasn’t around to witness the initial
rejection of Higgs’s proposal in 1964 (well, I was
around, but only barely), I can attest that by the
mid-1980s, the assessment had changed. The physics
community had, for the most part, fully bought into
the idea that there was a Higgs field permeating
space. In fact, in a graduate course I took that
covered what’s known as the Standard Model of
Particle Physics (the quantum equations physicists
have assembled to describe the particles of matter
and the dominant forces by which they influence
each other), the professor presented the Higgs field
with such certainty that for a long while I had no idea
it had yet to be established experimentally.
On occasion, that happens in physics. Mathematical
equations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale,
they can seemingly radiate reality so strongly, that
they become entrenched in the vernacular of
working physicists, even before there’s data to
confirm them.



Question 44:
The author most strongly suggests that the reason the scientific community initially rejected Higgs’s idea was that the idea
A) addressed a problem unnoticed by other physicists.
B) only worked if the equations were flawless.
C) rendered accepted theories in physics obsolete.
D) appeared to have little empirical basis.

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.



Question 3:
It can reasonably be inferred that Irma, the waitress, thinks Lymie is “through eating” (line 37) because
A) he has begun reading his book.
B) his plate is empty.
C) he is no longer holding his fork.
D) he has asked her to clear the table.

Passage 1
    The mental consequences of our online
info-crunching are not universally bad.
Certain cognitive skills are strengthened by our use
of computers and the Net. These tend to involve
more primitive mental functions, such as hand-eye
coordination, reflex response, and the processing of
visual cues. One much-cited study of video gaming
revealed that after just 10 days of playing action
games on computers, a group of young people had
significantly boosted the speed with which they could
shift their visual focus between various images and
tasks.
     It’s likely that Web browsing also strengthens
brain functions related to fast-paced problem
solving, particularly when it requires spotting
patterns in a welter of data. A British study of the
way women search for medical information online
indicated that an experienced Internet user can, at
least in some cases, assess the trustworthiness and
probable value of a Web page in a matter of seconds.
The more we practice surfing and scanning, the more
adept our brain becomes at those tasks.
    But it would be a serious mistake to look narrowly
at such benefits and conclude that the Web is making
us smarter. In a Science article published in early
2009, prominent developmental psychologist Patricia
Greenfield reviewed more than 40 studies of the
effects of various types of media on intelligence and
learning ability. She concluded that “every medium
develops some cognitive skills at the expense of
others.” Our growing use of the Net and other
screen-based technologies, she wrote, has led to the
“widespread and sophisticated development of
visual-spatial skills.” But those gains go hand in hand
with a weakening of our capacity for the kind of
“deep processing” that underpins “mindful
knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical
thinking, imagination, and reflection.”
    We know that the human brain is highly
plastic; neurons and synapses change as
circumstances change. When we adapt to a new
cultural phenomenon, including the use of a new
medium, we end up with a different brain, says
Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of the field of
neuroplasticity. That means our online habits
continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain
cells even when we’re not at a computer. We’re
exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming
and multitasking while ignoring those used for
reading and thinking deeply.

Passage 2
    Critics of new media sometimes use science itself
to press their case, citing research that shows how
“experience can change the brain.” But cognitive
neuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every
time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain
changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the
pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does
not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into
shape by experience.
    Experience does not revamp the basic
information-processing capacities of the brain.
Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just
that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen
after he read Leo Tolstoy’s famously long novel
War and Peace in one sitting: “It was about Russia.”
Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a
myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the
familiar sight of an SUV undulating between lanes as
the driver cuts deals on his cell phone.
    Moreover, the effects of experience are highly
specific to the experiences themselves. If you train
people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math
puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing
that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t
make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t
make you more logical, brain-training games don’t
make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk
up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they
immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read
lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.
    The effects of consuming electronic media are
likely to be far more limited than the panic implies.
Media critics write as if the brain takes on the
qualities of whatever it consumes, the informational
equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with ancient
peoples who believed that eating fierce animals made
them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in
rock videos turns your mental life into quick cuts or
that reading bullet points and online postings turns
your thoughts into bullet points and online postings.

On which of the following points would the authors of both passages most likely agree?
A) Computer-savvy children tend to demonstrate better hand-eye coordination than do their parents.

This passage is adapted from Rachel Ehrenberg, “Salt
Stretches in Nanoworld.” ©2009 by Society for Science & the
Public. The “nanoworld” is the world observed on a scale
one billionth that of ordinary human experience.

    Inflexible old salt becomes a softy in the
nanoworld, stretching like taffy to more than twice
its length, researchers report. The findings may lead
to new approaches for making nanowires that could
end up in solar cells or electronic circuits. The work
also suggests that these ultra-tiny salt wires may
already exist in sea spray and large underground salt
deposits.
    “We think nanowires are special and go to great
lengths to make them,” says study coauthor
Nathan Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque. “Maybe they are more common than
we think.”
    Metals such as gold or lead, in which bonding
angles are loosey-goosey, can stretch out at
temperatures well below their melting points.
But scientists don’t expect this superplasticity in a
rigid, crystalline material like salt, Moore says.
    This unusual behavior highlights that different
forces rule the nanoworld, says theoretical physicist
Krzysztof Kempa of Boston College. “Forget about
gravity. It plays no role,” he says. Surface tension and
electrostatic forces are much more important at this
scale.
    Moore and his colleagues discovered salt’s
stretchiness accidently. They were investigating how
water sticks to a surface such as salt and created a
super-dry salt sample for testing. After cleaving a
chunk of salt about the size of a sugar cube with a
razor, the scientists guided a microscope that detects
forces toward the surface. When the tip was far away
there was no measured force, but within about seven
nanometers a very strong attraction rapidly
developed between the diamond tip of the
microscope and the salt. The salt actually stretched
out to glom on to the microscope tip. Using an
electron microscope to see what was happening, the
researchers observed the nanowires.
    The initial attraction between the tip and salt
might be due to electrostatic forces, perhaps good old
van der Waals interactions, the researchers
speculate. Several mechanisms might lead to the
elasticity, including the excessive surface tension
found in the nanoworld (the same tension that allows
a water strider to skim the surface of a pond).
    The surface tension is so strong that as the
microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt
stretches, Kempa says. “The inside has no choice but
to rearrange the atoms, rather than break,” he says.
    This bizarre behavior is actually mirrored in the
macroworld, the researchers say. Huge underground
deposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is
believed to play a role at these scales. Perhaps salty
nanowires are present in these deposits as well.
    “Sodium chloride is everywhere—in the air, in
our bodies,” Moore says. “This may change our view
of things, of what’s happening at the nanoscale.”
    The work also suggests new techniques for
making nanowires, which are often created through
nano-imprinting techniques, Kempa says. “We
invoke the intuition of the macroworld,” he says.
“Maybe instead of stamping [nanowires] we should
be nano-pulling them.”

This passage is adapted from William Maxwell, The Folded
Leaf. ©1959 by William Maxwell. Originally published
in 1945.

    The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road
near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with
tables for two along the walls and tables for four
down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,
except for the series of murals depicting the four
seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window.
Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash
register, and ordered his dinner. The history book,
which he propped against the catsup and the glass
sugar bowl, had been used by others before him.
Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps,
drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the
body; also with names and messages no longer clear
and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other
page there was some marginal notation, either in ink
or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had
upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were
from tears.
    While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed
on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and
the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and
again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he
chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that
he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of
Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in
November of the same year, and all the powers
engaged in the war on either side sent
plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and
important assembly ever convoked to discuss and
determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria,
Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in
person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the
Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and
began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers
of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,
thought he was through eating and tried to take his
plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his
right thumb) presided over the Congress, and
Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented
France.
    A party of four, two men and two women, came
into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took
possession of the center table nearest Lymie.
The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts
which exposed the underside of their knees when
they sat down. One of the women had the face of a
young boy but disguised by one trick or another
(rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against
the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent
earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which
as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They
laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,
while they were deciding between soup and shrimp
cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was
the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch
of the women’s voices which caused Lymie to skim
over two whole pages without knowing what was on
them. Fortunately he realized this and went back.
Otherwise he might never have known about the
secret treaty concluded between England, France,
and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and
Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a
renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress
were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at
the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway
through them, a coat that he recognized as his
father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair.
Lymie closed the book and said, “I didn’t think you
were coming.”
    Time is probably no more unkind to sporting
characters than it is to other people, but physical
decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more
noticeable. Mr. Peters’ hair was turning gray and his
scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight
also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he
used to. His color was poor, and the flower had
disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an
American Legion button.
    Apparently he himself was not aware that there
had been any change. He straightened his tie
self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu,
he gestured with it so that the two women at the next
table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth
finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and
also the fact that his hands showed signs of the
manicurist, one can blame on the young man who
had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of
his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of
the moon. The young man had never for one second
deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at
Mr. Peters’ elbow, making him do things that were
not becoming in a man of forty-five.



Question 4:
Lymie’s primary impression of the “party of four” (line 42) is that they
A) are noisy and distracting.
B) are a refreshing change from the other customers.
C) resemble characters from his history book.
D) represent glamour and youth.

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled
with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left
to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify
the protein. Et voilà—human medicine! And, for
GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006,
becoming the world’s first transgenic animal drug.
Over the course of a year, the “milking parlors” on
GTC’s 300-acre farm in Massachusetts can collect
more than a kilogram of medicine from a single
animal.



Question 25:
What does the author suggest about the transgenic studies done in the 1980s and 1990s?
A) They were limited by the expensive nature of animal research.
B) They were not expected to yield products ready for human use.
C) They were completed when an anticoagulant compound was identified.
D) They focused only on the molecular properties of cows, goats, and sheep.

This passage is adapted from David Rotman, “How
Technology Is Destroying Jobs.” ©2013 by MIT Technology
Review.

    MIT business scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee have argued that impressive
advances in computer technology—from improved
industrial robotics to automated translation
services—are largely behind the sluggish
employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
more ominous for workers, they foresee dismal
prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful
new technologies are increasingly adopted not only
in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in
professions such as law, financial services, education,
and medicine.
    That robots, automation, and software can replace
people might seem obvious to anyone who’s worked
in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But
Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s claim is more troubling
and controversial. They believe that rapid
technological change has been destroying jobs faster
than it is creating them, contributing to the
stagnation of median income and the growth of
inequality in the United States. And, they suspect,
something similar is happening in other
technologically advanced countries.
    As evidence, Brynjolfsson and McAfee point to a
chart that only an economist could love. In
economics, productivity—the amount of economic
value created for a given unit of input, such as an
hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and
wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the
chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines
represent productivity and total employment in the
United States. For years after World War II, the
two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in
jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The
pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value
from their workers, the country as a whole became
richer, which fueled more economic activity and
created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the
lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,
but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a
significant gap appears between the two lines,
showing economic growth with no parallel increase
in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the
“great decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is
confident that technology is behind both the healthy
growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.
    It’s a startling assertion because it threatens the
faith that many economists place in technological
progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that
technology boosts productivity and makes societies
wealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark
side: technological progress is eliminating the need
for many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker
worse off than before. Brynjolfsson can point to a
second chart indicating that median income is failing
to rise even as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s
the great paradox of our era,” he says. “Productivity
is at record levels, innovation has never been faster,
and yet at the same time, we have a falling median
income and we have fewer jobs. People are falling
behind because technology is advancing so fast and
our skills and organizations aren’t keeping up.”
    While technological changes can be painful for
workers whose skills no longer match the needs of
employers, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist,
says that no historical pattern shows these shifts
leading to a net decrease in jobs over an extended
period. Katz has done extensive research on how
technological advances have affected jobs over the
last few centuries—describing, for example, how
highly skilled artisans in the mid-19th century were
displaced by lower-skilled workers in factories.
While it can take decades for workers to acquire the
expertise needed for new types of employment, he
says, “we never have run out of jobs. There is no
long-term trend of eliminating work for people. Over
the long term, employment rates are fairly
stable. People have always been able to create new
jobs. People come up with new things to do.”
    Still, Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is
something different about today’s digital
technologies—something that could affect an even
broader range of work. The question, he says, is
whether economic history will serve as a useful
guide. Will the job disruptions caused by technology
be temporary as the workforce adapts, or will we see
a science-fiction scenario in which automated
processes and robots with superhuman skills take
over a broad swath of human tasks? Though Katz
expects the historical pattern to hold, it is “genuinely
a question,” he says. “If technology disrupts enough,
who knows what will happen?”

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.



Question 31:
According to the passage, G.L. differed from Olausson’s other test subjects in terms of the
A) number of cortices activated in the brain during gentle brushing.
B) physical dimensions of the somatosensory cortex.
C) intensity of nerve signals required to activate the insular cortex.

Passage 1 is Beecher’s response to Grimké’s views.
Passage 2 is Grimké’s response to Beecher.

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.



Question 21:
Beecher would most likely have reacted to lines 65-68 (“Now... woman”) of Passage 2 with
A) sympathy, because she feels that human beings owe each other a debt to work together in the world.
B) agreement, because she feels that human responsibilities are a natural product of human rights.
C) dismay, because she feels that women actually have a more difficult role to play in society than men do.
D) disagreement, because she feels that the natures of men and women are fundamentally different.

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the
Texas gourd study.

Passage 1 is adapted from a speech delivered in 1898 by
Albert J. Beveridge, “March of the Flag.” Passage 2 is
adapted from a speech delivered in 1900 by William
Jennings Bryan, “Imperialism.”

Passage 1
    Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
Line countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile... working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands...a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century...a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day....
    Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government... shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will builda... civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

Passage 2
    If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
    The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
    Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
    Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
    Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

This passage is adapted from Virginia Woolf, Three Guineas.
©1938 by Harcourt, Inc. Here, Woolf considers the situation
of women in English society.

    Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames,
an admirable vantage ground for us to make a
survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden
with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are
the domes and spires of the city; on the other,
Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a
place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not
now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here
to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the
procession—the procession of the sons of educated
men.
    There they go, our brothers who have been
educated at public schools and universities,
mounting those steps, passing in and out of those
doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching,
administering justice, practising medicine,
transacting business, making money. It is a solemn
sight always—a procession, like a caravanserai
crossing a desert. . . . But now, for the past twenty
years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a
photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of
time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic
appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail
end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that
makes a difference. We who have looked so long at
the pageant in books, or from a curtained window
watched educated men leaving the house at about
nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house
at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively
no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount
those steps, pass in and out of those doors,... make
money, administer justice. . . . We who now agitate
these humble pens may in another century or two
speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us
then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine
spirit—a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say
whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in
military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts,
swords at our sides, and something like the old
family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that
venerable object was never decorated with plumes of
white horsehair. You laugh—indeed the shadow of
the private house still makes those dresses look a
little queer. We have worn private clothes so
long. . . . But we have not come here to laugh, or to
talk of fashions—men’s and women’s. We are here,
on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions.
And they are very important questions; and we have
very little time in which to answer them. The
questions that we have to ask and to answer about
that procession during this moment of transition are
so important that they may well change the lives of
all men and women for ever. For we have to ask
ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that
procession, or don’t we? On what terms shall we join
that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the
procession of educated men? The moment is short; it
may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a
matter of a few months longer.... But, you will
object, you have no time to think; you have your
battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to
organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam.
As you know from your own experience, and there
are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men
have always done their thinking from hand to
mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the
cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought
while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the
cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our
brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on
thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think
we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while
we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations
and Lord Mayor’s Shows; let us think . . . in the
gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts;
let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals.
Let us never cease from thinking—what is this
“civilization” in which we find ourselves? What are
these ceremonies and why should we take part in
them? What are these professions and why
should we make money out of them? Where in
short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of
educated men?



Question 35:
According to the passage, Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it
A) is conducive to a mood of fanciful reflection.
B) provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
C) is within sight of historic episodes to which she alludes.

This passage is adapted from David Owen, The Conundrum:
How Scientific Innovation, Increased Efficiency, and Good
Intentions Can Make Our Energy and Climate Problems Worse.
©2011 by David Owen.

    Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
Line prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
    One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control
measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
    Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
    One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.



Question 29:
It can reasonably be inferred that one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiment was to determine the
A) precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
B) relationship between body hair and CT fiber function.
C) role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain.
D) effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling.

This passage is adapted from Emily Anthes, Frankenstein's
Cat. ©2013 by Emily Anthes.

    When scientists first learned how to edit the
genomes of animals, they began to imagine all the
ways they could use this new power. Creating
brightly colored novelty pets was not a high priority.
Instead, most researchers envisioned far more
consequential applications, hoping to create
genetically engineered animals that saved human
lives. One enterprise is now delivering on this dream.
Welcome to the world of “pharming,” in which
simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living
pharmaceutical factories.
    Many of the proteins that our cells crank out
naturally make for good medicine. Our bodies’ own
enzymes, hormones, clotting factors, and antibodies
are commonly used to treat cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, and more. The trouble is that
it’s difficult and expensive to make these compounds
on an industrial scale, and as a result, patients can
face shortages of the medicines they need. Dairy
animals, on the other hand, are expert protein
producers, their udders swollen with milk. So the
creation of the first transgenic animals—first mice,
then other species—in the 1980s gave scientists an
idea: What if they put the gene for a human antibody
or enzyme into a cow, goat, or sheep? If they put the
gene in just the right place, under the control of the
right molecular switch, maybe they could engineer
animals that produced healing human proteins in
their milk. Then doctors could collect medicine by
the bucketful.
    Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, studies provided
proof of principle, as scientists created transgenic
mice, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, and rabbits that did in
fact make therapeutic compounds in their milk.
At first, this work was merely gee-whiz, scientific
geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.
That all changed with ATryn, a drug produced by the
Massachusetts firm GTC Biotherapeutics. ATryn is
antithrombin, an anticoagulant that can be used to
prevent life-threatening blood clots. The compound,
made by our liver cells, plays a key role in keeping
our bodies clot-free. It acts as a molecular bouncer,
sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting
them out of the bloodstream. But as many as 1 in
2,000 Americans are born with a genetic mutation
that prevents them from making antithrombin.
These patients are prone to clots, especially in their
legs and lungs, and they are at elevated risk of
suffering from fatal complications during surgery
and childbirth. Supplemental antithrombin can
reduce this risk, and GTC decided to try to
manufacture the compound using genetically
engineered goats.
    To create its special herd of goats, GTC used
microinjection, the same technique that produced
GloFish and AquAdvantage salmon. The company’s
scientists took the gene for human antithrombin and
injected it directly into fertilized goat eggs. Then they
implanted the eggs in the wombs of female goats.
When the kids were born, some of them proved to be
transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their
cells. The researchers paired the antithrombin gene
with a promoter (which is a sequence of DNA that
controls gene activity) that is normally active in the
goat’s mammary glands during milk production.
When the transgenic females lactated, the promoter
turned the transgene on and the goats’ udders filled
with milk containing antithrombin. All that was left
to do was to collect the milk, and extract and purify
the protein. Et voilà—human medicine! And, for
GTC, liquid gold. ATryn hit the market in 2006,
becoming the world’s first transgenic animal drug.
Over the course of a year, the “milking parlors” on
GTC’s 300-acre farm in Massachusetts can collect
more than a kilogram of medicine from a single
animal.

This passage is adapted from Rachel Ehrenberg, “Salt
Stretches in Nanoworld.” ©2009 by Society for Science & the
Public. The “nanoworld” is the world observed on a scale
one billionth that of ordinary human experience.

    Inflexible old salt becomes a softy in the
nanoworld, stretching like taffy to more than twice
its length, researchers report. The findings may lead
to new approaches for making nanowires that could
end up in solar cells or electronic circuits. The work
also suggests that these ultra-tiny salt wires may
already exist in sea spray and large underground salt
deposits.
    “We think nanowires are special and go to great
lengths to make them,” says study coauthor
Nathan Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque. “Maybe they are more common than
we think.”
    Metals such as gold or lead, in which bonding
angles are loosey-goosey, can stretch out at
temperatures well below their melting points.
But scientists don’t expect this superplasticity in a
rigid, crystalline material like salt, Moore says.
    This unusual behavior highlights that different
forces rule the nanoworld, says theoretical physicist
Krzysztof Kempa of Boston College. “Forget about
gravity. It plays no role,” he says. Surface tension and
electrostatic forces are much more important at this
scale.
    Moore and his colleagues discovered salt’s
stretchiness accidently. They were investigating how
water sticks to a surface such as salt and created a
super-dry salt sample for testing. After cleaving a
chunk of salt about the size of a sugar cube with a
razor, the scientists guided a microscope that detects
forces toward the surface. When the tip was far away
there was no measured force, but within about seven
nanometers a very strong attraction rapidly
developed between the diamond tip of the
microscope and the salt. The salt actually stretched
out to glom on to the microscope tip. Using an
electron microscope to see what was happening, the
researchers observed the nanowires.
    The initial attraction between the tip and salt
might be due to electrostatic forces, perhaps good old
van der Waals interactions, the researchers
speculate. Several mechanisms might lead to the
elasticity, including the excessive surface tension
found in the nanoworld (the same tension that allows
a water strider to skim the surface of a pond).
    The surface tension is so strong that as the
microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt
stretches, Kempa says. “The inside has no choice but
to rearrange the atoms, rather than break,” he says.
    This bizarre behavior is actually mirrored in the
macroworld, the researchers say. Huge underground
deposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is
believed to play a role at these scales. Perhaps salty
nanowires are present in these deposits as well.
    “Sodium chloride is everywhere—in the air, in
our bodies,” Moore says. “This may change our view
of things, of what’s happening at the nanoscale.”
    The work also suggests new techniques for
making nanowires, which are often created through
nano-imprinting techniques, Kempa says. “We
invoke the intuition of the macroworld,” he says.
“Maybe instead of stamping [nanowires] we should
be nano-pulling them.”

Passage 1 is adapted from Abraham Lincoln, “Address to the
Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.” Originally
delivered in 1838. Passage 2 is from Henry David Thoreau,
“Resistance to Civil Government.” Originally published
in 1849.

Passage 1
    Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars....
    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.
    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Passage 2
    Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt?...
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
    As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong....
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

Both passages make the point that teixobactin could be useful in
A) standardizing the future development of antibiotics produced in laboratory environments.

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

This passage is adapted from Elsa Youngsteadt, “Decoding a
Flower’s Message.” ©2012 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific
Research Society.

    Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
    In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
    Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.
    The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
    Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
    “It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
    What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
    That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)
    The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If
you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more
pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by
your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist
at Cornell University who was not involved in the
Texas gourd study.

These passages are adapted from the Lincoln‑Douglas
debates. Passage 1 is from a statement by Stephen Douglas.
Passage 2 is from a statement by Abraham Lincoln. Douglas
and Lincoln engaged in a series of debates while competing
for a US Senate seat in 1858.

Passage 1
    Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government....
    I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle
of State rights and State sovereignty, each State
regulating its own affairs and minding its own
business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just
as fast and as far as we need the territory....

Passage 2
    In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
    But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same
causes that produced agitation at one time will not
have the same effect at another?



Question 40:
Both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relationship to
A) the expansion of the Union.
B) questions of morality.
C) religious toleration.

This passage is adapted from Jeffrey Mervis, “Why Null
Results Rarely See the Light of Day.” ©2014 by American
Association for the Advancement of Science.


    The question of what to do with null
results—when researchers fail to see an effect that
should be detectable—has long been hotly debated
among those conducting medical trials, where the
results can have a big impact on lives and corporate
bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to
the social and behavioral sciences, which also have
the potential to sway public and social policy.
There were little hard data, however, on how often or
why null results were squelched. “Yes, it’s true that
null results are not as exciting,” political scientist
Gary King of Harvard University says. “But I suspect
another reason they are rarely published is that there
are many, many ways to produce null results by
messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.”
    In a recent study, Stanford political economist
Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students
examined every study since 2002 that was funded by
a competitive grants program called TESS
(Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences).
TESS allows scientists to order up Internet-based
surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test
a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters
tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal
dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus
on policy matters).
    Malhotra’s team tracked down working papers
from most of the experiments that weren’t published,
and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to
their results. In their e-mailed responses, some
scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more
pressing matters—but many also believed the
journals just wouldn’t be interested. “The
unfortunate reality of the publishing world [is] that
null effects do not tell a clear story,” said one
scientist. Said another, “Never published, definitely
disappointed to not see any major effects.”
    Their answers suggest to Malhotra that rescuing
findings from the file drawer will require a shift in
expectations. “What needs to change is the
culture—the author’s belief about what will happen if
the research is written up,” he says.
    Not unexpectedly, the statistical strength of the
findings made a huge difference in whether they
were ever published. Overall, 42% of the experiments
produced statistically significant results. Of those,
62% were ultimately published, compared with 21%
of the null results. However, the Stanford team was
surprised that researchers didn’t even write up
65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.
    Scientists not involved in the study praise its
“clever” design. “It’s a very important paper” that
“starts to put numbers on things we want to
understand,” says economist Edward Miguel of the
University of California, Berkeley.
    He and others note that the bias against null
studies can waste time and money when researchers
devise new studies replicating strategies already
found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish
significant results from similar experiments in the
future, they could look stronger than they should
because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even
more troubling to Malhotra was the fact that two
scientists whose initial studies “didn’t work out”
went on to publish results based on a smaller sample.
“The non-TESS version of the same study, in which
we used a student sample, did yield fruit,” noted one
investigator.
    A registry for data generated by all experiments
would address these problems, the authors argue.
They say it should also include a “preanalysis” plan,
that is, a detailed description of what the scientist
hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed.
Such plans would help deter researchers from
tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in
search of more publishable results.

This passage is adapted from “How the Web Affects
Memory.” ©2011 by Harvard Magazine Inc.


    Search engines have changed the way we use the
Internet, putting vast sources of information just a
few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology
Line Daniel Wegner’s recent research proves that
websites—and the Internet—are changing much
more than technology itself. They are changing the
way our memories function.
    Wegner’s latest study, “Google Effects on
Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having
Information at Our Fingertips,” shows that when
people have access to search engines, they remember
fewer facts and less information because they know
they can rely on “search” as a readily available
shortcut.
    Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes
the new findings show that the Internet has become
part of a transactive memory source, a method by
which our brains compartmentalize information.
First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive
memory exists in many forms, as when a husband
relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.
“[It is] this whole network of memory where you
don’t have to remember everything in the world
yourself,” he says. “You just have to remember who
knows it.” Now computers and technology as well
are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.
    The idea validates habits already forming in our
daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary
location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars
remove the need to memorize directions.
Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our
memories too far to remember the name of an
obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan—we
just type our questions into Google. “We become
part of the Internet in a way,” he says. “We become
part of the system and we end up trusting it.”
    Working with researchers Betsy Sparrow of
Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University
of Wisconsin–Madison, Wegner conducted four
experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using
various forms of memory recall to test reliance on
computers. In the first experiment, participants
demonstrated that they were more likely to think of
computer terms like “Yahoo” or “Google” after being
asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other
experiments, participants were asked to type a
collection of readily memorable statements, such as
“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” Half the
subjects were told that their work would be saved to a
computer; the other half were informed that the
statements would be erased. In subsequent memory
testing, participants who were told their work would
not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In
a fourth experiment, participants typed into a
computer statements they were told would be saved
in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the
statements. Finally, they were given cues to the
wording and asked to name the folders where the
statements were stored. The participants proved
better able to recall the folder locations than the
statements themselves.
    Wegner concedes that questions remain about
whether dependence on computers will affect
memories negatively: “Nobody knows now what the
effects are of these tools on logical thinking.”
Students who have trouble remembering distinct
facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts
in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation
overall is beneficial, likening dependence on
computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or
other prosthetic device.
    And even though we may not be taxing our
memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using
them to consider where the facts are located and how
to access them. “We still have to remember things,”
Wegner explains. “We’re just remembering a
different range of things.” He believes his study will
lead to further research into understanding computer
dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent
of human interdependence with the computer
world—pinpointing the “movable dividing line
between us and our computers in cyber networks.”



Question 16:
The discussion of the experiments suggests that people are inclined to think of specific information sources in response to being
A) required to memorize details that will then be made inaccessible.
B) directed to develop a system for organizing and saving content.
C) asked to provide facts that are not already familiar to them.
D) prompted to identify terms related to dependence on computers.

This passage is adapted from Alan Ehrenhalt, The Great
Inversion and the Future of the American City. ©2013 by
Vintage. Ehrenhalt is an urbanologist—a scholar of cities
and their development. Demographic inversion is a
phenomenon that describes the rearrangement of living
patterns throughout a metropolitan area.

    We are not witnessing the abandonment of the
suburbs, or a movement of millions of people back to
the city all at once. The 2010 census certainly did not
turn up evidence of a middle-class stampede to the
nation’s cities. The news was mixed: Some of the
larger cities on the East Coast tended to gain
population, albeit in small increments. Those in the
Midwest, including Chicago, tended to lose
substantial numbers. The cities that showed gains in
overall population during the entire decade tended to
be in the South and Southwest. But when it comes to
measuring demographic inversion, raw census
numbers are an ineffective blunt instrument. A closer
look at the results shows that the most powerful
demographic events of the past decade were the
movement of African Americans out of central cities
(180,000 of them in Chicago alone) and the
settlement of immigrant groups in suburbs, often
ones many miles distant from downtown.
Central-city areas that gained affluent residents in
the first part of the decade maintained that
population in the recession years from 2007 to 2009.
They also, according to a 2011 study by Brookings,
suffered considerably less from increased
unemployment than the suburbs did. Not many
young professionals moved to new downtown
condos in the recession years because few such
residences were being built. But there is no reason to
believe that the demographic trends prevailing prior
to the construction bust will not resume once that
bust is over. It is important to remember that
demographic inversion is not a proxy for population
growth; it can occur in cities that are growing, those
whose numbers are flat, and even in those
undergoing a modest decline in size.
    America’s major cities face enormous fiscal
problems, many of them the result of public pension
obligations they incurred in the more prosperous
years of the past two decades. Some, Chicago
prominent among them, simply are not producing
enough revenue to support the level of public
services to which most of the citizens have grown to
feel entitled. How the cities are going to solve this
problem, I do not know. What I do know is that if
fiscal crisis were going to drive affluent professionals
out of central cities, it would have done so by now.
There is no evidence that it has.
    The truth is that we are living at a moment in
which the massive outward migration of the affluent
that characterized the second half of the
twentieth century is coming to an end. And we need
to adjust our perceptions of cities, suburbs, and
urban mobility as a result.
    Much of our perspective on the process of
metropolitan settlement dates, whether we realize it
or not, from a paper written in 1925 by the
University of Chicago sociologist Ernest W. Burgess.
It was Burgess who defined four urban/suburban
zones of settlement: a central business district; an
area of manufacturing just beyond it; then a
residential area inhabited by the industrial and
immigrant working class; and finally an outer
enclave of single-family dwellings.
    Burgess was right about the urban America of
1925; he was right about the urban America of 1974.
Virtually every city in the country had a downtown,
where the commercial life of the metropolis was
conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had
districts of working-class residences just beyond that;
and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the
upper middle class at the far end of the continuum.
As a family moved up the economic ladder, it also
moved outward from crowded working-class
districts to more spacious apartments and,
eventually, to a suburban home. The suburbs of
Burgess’s time bore little resemblance to those at the
end of the twentieth century, but the theory still
essentially worked. People moved ahead in life by
moving farther out.
    But in the past decade, in quite a few places, this
model has ceased to describe reality. There are still
downtown commercial districts, but there are no
factory districts lying next to them. There are
scarcely any factories at all. These close-in parts of
the city, whose few residents Burgess described as
dwelling in “submerged regions of poverty,
degradation and disease,” are increasingly the
preserve of the affluent who work in the commercial
core. And just as crucially newcomers to America are
not settling on the inside and accumulating the
resources to move out; they are living in the suburbs
from day one.

Revolution in France. Originally published in 1790. Passage 2
is adapted from Thomas Paine, Rights of Man. Originally
published in 1791.

Passage 1
    To avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and
versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of
obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have
consecrated the state, that no man should approach
to look into its defects or corruptions but with due
caution; that he should never dream of beginning its
reformation by its subversion; that he should
approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of
a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By
this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror
on those children of their country who are prompt
rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him
into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their
poisonous weeds, and wild incantations, they may
regenerate the paternal constitution, and renovate
their father’s life.
    Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts
for objects of mere occasional interest may be
dissolved at pleasure—but the state ought not to be
considered as nothing better than a partnership
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or
tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken
up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved
by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with
other reverence; because it is not a partnership in
things subservient only to the gross animal existence
of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a
partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained
in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
only between those who are living, but between those
who are living, those who are dead, and those who
are to be born. . . . The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at
their pleasure, and on their speculations of a
contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear
asunder the bands of their subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,
unconnected chaos of elementary principles.

Passage 2
    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is
the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who
are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each
other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagination
can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can
exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid
down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence,
and the other not in, and who never can meet in this
world, that the one should control the other to the
end of time?...
    The circumstances of the world are continually
changing, and the opinions of men change also; and
as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in
one age, may be thought wrong and found
inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to
decide, the living, or the dead?

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”

The author includes the quotation “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing” (lines 17-18) to
A) explain that the current created by a bird differs from that of an airplane.
B) stress the amount of control exerted by birds flying in a V formation.

This passage is adapted from Sabrina Richards, “Pleasant to
the Touch.” ©2012 by The Scientist.

    In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
Line stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
    Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-
conducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
    Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
    But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found
only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
    Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
    To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
    Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
    Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.



Question 30:
The main purpose of the sixth paragraph (lines 64-75) is to
A) identify those of G.L.’s neurological conditions that might be relieved by the experiment.
B) contextualize the nerve function of G.L. by comparing it with that of other adults.

This passage is adapted from Stephen Coleman, Scott
Anthony, and David E. Morrison, “Public Trust in the News.”
©2009 by Stephen Coleman.

    The news is a form of public knowledge.
Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the
health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a
private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge
increases in value as it is shared by more people. The
date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;
the causes and consequences of an environmental
disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular
law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all
examples of public knowledge that people are
generally expected to know in order to be considered
informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or
private knowledge, which is generally left to
individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is
promoted even to those who might not think it
matters to them. In short, the circulation of public
knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded
as a public good which cannot be solely
demand-driven.
    The production, circulation, and reception
of public knowledge is a complex process. It is
generally accepted that public knowledge should
be authoritative, but there is not always
common agreement about what the public needs to
know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and
how authoritative reputations should be determined
and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The
Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely
regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative
agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied
the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of
authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the
opinions of others.” As part of the general process of
the transformation of authority whereby there has
been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional
sources of public knowledge, the demand has been
for all authority to make explicit the frames of value
which determine their decisions. Centres of news
production, as our focus groups show, have not been
exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps
some news journalists feel uneasy about this
renegotiation of their authority:
    Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the
    “most read” lists on their own and other websites
    to work out which stories matter to readers and
    viewers. And now the audience—which used to
    know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of
    journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our
    credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008).
    The result of democratising access to TV news
    could be political disengagement by the majority
    and a dumbing down through a popularity
    contest of stories (online news editor, 2007).
    Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,
they amount to more than straightforward
professional defensiveness. In their reference to an
audience “which used to know its place” and
conflation between democratisation and “dumbing
down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular
mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by
experts, immune from populist pressures; and
disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive
recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down
opportunities for popular involvement in the making
of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional
claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are
right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every
institutional level in contemporary society,
scepticism towards the epistemological authority of
expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed
by several of our focus group participants, that the
news media should be “informative rather than
authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to
“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their
slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient
information” from which “we would be able to form
opinions of our own.”
    At stake here are two distinct conceptions of
authority. The journalists we have quoted are
resistant to the democratisation of news:
the supremacy of the clickstream (according to
which editors raise or lower the profile of stories
according to the number of readers clicking on them
online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”
news; the demands of some audience members for
raw news rather than constructed narratives.




Question 12:
According to the passage, which expectation do traditional authorities now face?
A) They should be uninfluenced by commercial considerations.
B) They should be committed to bringing about positive social change.
C) They should be respectful of the difference between public and private knowledge.

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.



Question 13:
In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women’s effect on public life is largely
A) overlooked, because few men are interested in women’s thoughts about politics.
B) indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
C) unnecessary, because men are able to govern society themselves.
D) symbolic, because women tend to be more idealistic about politics than men are.

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

This passage is adapted from Joshua Foer, Moonwalking
with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything.
©2011 by Joshua Foer.


    In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College
London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out
what effect, if any, all that driving around the
labyrinthine streets of London might have on
cabbies’ brains. When she brought sixteen taxi
drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an
MRI scanner, she found one surprising and
important difference. The right posterior
hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be
involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger
than normal in the cabbies—a small but very
significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of
that way-finding around London had physically
altered the gross structure of their brains. The more
years a cabbie had been on the road, the more
pronounced the effect.
    The brain is a mutable organ, capable—within
limits—of reorganizing itself and readapting to new
kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as
neuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the
adult brain was incapable of spawning new
neurons—that while learning caused synapses to
rearrange themselves and new links between brain
cells to form, the brain’s basic anatomical structure
was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the
old inherited wisdom was simply not true.
    After her groundbreaking study of London
cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to
mental athletes. She teamed up with Elizabeth
Valentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic
monograph Superior Memory, to study ten
individuals who had finished near the top of the
World Memory Championship. They wanted to find
out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London
cabbies’—structurally different from the rest of ours,
or if they were somehow just making better use of
memory abilities that we all possess.
    The researchers put both the mental athletes and a
group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners
and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers,
black-and-white photographs of people’s faces, and
magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains
were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it
was possible that they might discover anatomical
differences in the brains of the memory champs,
evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized
themselves in the process of doing all that intensive
remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the
imaging data, not a single significant structural
difference turned up. The brains of the mental
athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those
of the control subjects. What’s more, on every single
test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’
scores came back well within the normal range. The
memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t
have special brains.
    But there was one telling difference between the
brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects:
When the researchers looked at which parts of the
brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were
memorizing, they found that they were activating
entirely different circuitry. According to the
functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that
were less active in the control subjects seemed to be
working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
    Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were
learning new information, they were engaging
several regions of the brain known to be involved in
two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial
navigation, including the same right posterior
hippocampal region that the London cabbies had
enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first
glance, this wouldn’t seem to make any sense.
Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in
their mind’s eye when they were trying to learn
three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating
like London cabbies when they’re supposed to be
remembering the shapes of snowflakes?
    Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes
to describe exactly what was going through their
minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said
they were consciously converting the information
they were being asked to memorize into images, and
distributing those images along familiar spatial
journeys. They weren’t doing this automatically, or
because it was an inborn talent they’d nurtured since
childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural
activity that Maguire’s fMRIs turned up were the
result of training and practice.



Question 42:
According to the passage, Maguire’s findings regarding taxi drivers are significant because they
A) demonstrate the validity of a new method.
B) provide evidence for a popular viewpoint.
C) call into question an earlier consensus.
D) challenge the authenticity of previous data.

he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.

qThis passage is adapted from Carolyn Gramling, “Source of
Mysterious Medieval Eruption Identified.” ©2013 by
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

    About 750 years ago, a powerful volcano erupted
somewhere on Earth, kicking off a centuries-long
cold snap known as the Little Ice Age. Identifying the
volcano responsible has been tricky.
    That a powerful volcano erupted somewhere in
the world, sometime in the Middle Ages, is written in
polar ice cores in the form of layers of sulfate
deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass. These
cores suggest that the amount of sulfur the mystery
volcano sent into the stratosphere put it firmly
among the ranks of the strongest climate-perturbing
eruptions of the current geological epoch, the
Holocene, a period that stretches from 10,000 years
ago to the present. A haze of stratospheric sulfur
cools the climate by reflecting solar energy back into
space.
    In 2012, a team of scientists led by geochemist
Gifford Miller strengthened the link between the
mystery eruption and the onset of the Little Ice Age
by using radiocarbon dating of dead plant material
from beneath the ice caps on Baffin Island and
Iceland, as well as ice and sediment core data, to
determine that the cold summers and ice growth
began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 C.E. (and
became intensified between 1430 and 1455 C.E.).
Such a sudden onset pointed to a huge volcanic
eruption injecting sulfur into the stratosphere and
starting the cooling. Subsequent, unusually large and
frequent eruptions of other volcanoes, as well as
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks persisting long after the
aerosols have been removed from the atmosphere,
may have prolonged the cooling through the 1700s.
    Volcanologist Franck Lavigne and colleagues now
think they’ve identified the volcano in question:
Indonesia’s Samalas. One line of evidence, they note,
is historical records. According to Babad Lombok,
records of the island written on palm leaves in Old
Javanese, Samalas erupted catastrophically before the
end of the 13th century, devastating surrounding
villages—including Lombok’s capital at the time,
Pamatan—with ash and fast-moving sweeps of hot
rock and gas called pyroclastic flows.
    The researchers then began to reconstruct the
formation of the large, 800-meter-deep caldera [a
basin-shaped volcanic crater] that now sits atop the
volcano. They examined 130 outcrops on the flanks
of the volcano, exposing sequences of pumice—ash
hardened into rock—and other pyroclastic material.
The volume of ash deposited, and the estimated
height of the eruption plume (43 kilometers above
sea level) put the eruption’s magnitude at a
minimum of 7 on the volcanic explosivity index
(which has a scale of 1 to 8)—making it one of the
largest known in the Holocene.
    The team also performed radiocarbon analyses on
carbonized tree trunks and branches buried within
the pyroclastic deposits to confirm the date of the
eruption; it could not, they concluded, have
happened before 1257 C.E., and certainly happened
in the 13th century.
    It’s not a total surprise that an Indonesian volcano
might be the source of the eruption, Miller says. “An
equatorial eruption is more consistent with the
apparent climate impacts.” And, he adds, with sulfate
appearing in both polar ice caps—Arctic and
Antarctic—there is “a strong consensus” that this
also supports an equatorial source.
    Another possible candidate—both in terms of
timing and geographical location—is Ecuador’s
Quilotoa, estimated to have last erupted between
1147 and 1320 C.E. But when Lavigne’s team
examined shards of volcanic glass from this volcano,
they found that they didn’t match the chemical
composition of the glass found in polar ice cores,
whereas the Samalas glass is a much closer match.
That, they suggest, further strengthens the case that
Samalas was responsible for the medieval “year
without summer” in 1258 C.E.



Question 48:
As used in line 68, the phrase “Another possible candidate” implies that
A) powerful volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
B) the effects of volcanic eruptions can last for centuries.
C) scientists know of other volcanoes that erupted during the Middle Ages.
D) other volcanoes have calderas that are very large.

This passage is adapted from David Owen, The Conundrum:
How Scientific Innovation, Increased Efficiency, and Good
Intentions Can Make Our Energy and Climate Problems Worse.
©2011 by David Owen.

    Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
Line prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
    One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control
measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
    Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
    One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

This passage is adapted from Daniyal Mueenuddin,
“Nawabdin Electrician.” ©2009 by Daniyal Mueenuddin.

    Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
    K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator
glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
    Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
    “Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
    The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
    “What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”
    “Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
    “And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
    “Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
    The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
    The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.

This passage is adapted from J. D. Watson and F. H. C. Crick,
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid.” ©1953 by Nature Publishing Group. Watson and Crick
deduced the structure of DNA using evidence from Rosalind
Franklin and R. G. Gosling’s X-ray crystallography diagrams
of DNA and from Erwin Chargaff’s data on the base
composition of DNA.

    The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a
very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a
regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.
To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which
can be of four different types. Two of the possible
bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the
other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.
So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the
chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of
phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.
    The first feature of our structure which is of
biological interest is that it consists not of one chain,
but of two. These two chains are both coiled around
a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that
since there was only one chain in the chemical
formula there would only be one in the structural
unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray
evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.
    The other biologically important feature is the
manner in which the two chains are held together.
This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases.
The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base
from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single
base from the other. The important point is that only
certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.
One member of a pair must be a purine and the other
a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two
chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for
example, there would not be room for it.
    We believe that the bases will be present almost
entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true,
the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are:
adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine.
Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but
when it does, its partner on the other chain must
always be thymine.
    The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is
completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of
bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a
long molecule many different permutations are
possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise
sequence of bases is the code which carries the
genetical information. If the actual order of the bases
on one of the pair of chains were given, one could
write down the exact order of the bases on the other
one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain
is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic
acid molecule might duplicate itself.

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1838 by
Sara T. Smith at the Second Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women.

    We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
Line sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the
estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of
the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
    And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
    By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands,” will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
    But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

This passage is adapted from Iain King, “Can Economics Be
Ethical?” ©2013 by Prospect Publishing.

    Recent debates about the economy have
rediscovered the question, “is that right?”, where
“right” means more than just profits or efficiency.
Some argue that because the free markets allow
for personal choice, they are already ethical. Others
have accepted the ethical critique and embraced
corporate social responsibility. But before we can
label any market outcome as “immoral,” or sneer at
economists who try to put a price on being ethical,
we need to be clear on what we are talking about.
    There are different views on where ethics should
apply when someone makes an economic decision.
Consider Adam Smith, widely regarded as the
founder of modern economics. He was a moral
philosopher who believed sympathy for others was
the basis for ethics (we would call it empathy
nowadays). But one of his key insights in The Wealth
of Nations was that acting on this empathy could be
counter-productive—he observed people becoming
better off when they put their own empathy aside,
and interacted in a self-interested way. Smith justifies
selfish behavior by the outcome. Whenever planners
use cost-benefit analysis to justify a new railway line,
or someone retrains to boost his or her earning
power, or a shopper buys one to get one free, they are
using the same approach: empathizing with
someone, and seeking an outcome that makes that
person as well off as possible—although the person
they are empathizing with may be themselves in the
future.
   Instead of judging consequences, Aristotle
said ethics was about having the right
character—displaying virtues like courage and
honesty. It is a view put into practice whenever
business leaders are chosen for their good character.
But it is a hard philosophy to teach—just how much
loyalty should you show to a manufacturer that keeps
losing money? Show too little and you’re a “greed is
good” corporate raider; too much and you’re wasting
money on unproductive capital. Aristotle thought
there was a golden mean between the two extremes,
and finding it was a matter of fine judgment. But if
ethics is about character, it’s not clear what those
characteristics should be.
    There is yet another approach: instead of rooting
ethics in character or the consequences of actions, we
can focus on our actions themselves. From this
perspective some things are right, some wrong—we
should buy fair trade goods, we shouldn’t tell lies in
advertisements. Ethics becomes a list of
commandments, a catalog of “dos” and “don’ts.”
When a finance official refuses to devalue a currency
because they have promised not to, they are defining
ethics this way. According to this approach
devaluation can still be bad, even if it would make
everybody better off.
    Many moral dilemmas arise when these three
versions pull in different directions but clashes are
not inevitable. Take fair trade coffee (coffee that is
sold with a certification that indicates the farmers
and workers who produced it were paid a fair wage),
for example: buying it might have good
consequences, be virtuous, and also be the right way
to act in a flawed market. Common ground like this
suggests that, even without agreement on where
ethics applies, ethical economics is still possible.
    Whenever we feel queasy about “perfect”
competitive markets, the problem is often rooted in a
phony conception of people. The model of man on
which classical economics is based—an entirely
rational and selfish being—is a parody, as
John Stuart Mill, the philosopher who pioneered the
model, accepted. Most people—even economists—
now accept that this “economic man” is a fiction.
We behave like a herd; we fear losses more than we
hope for gains; rarely can our brains process all the
relevant facts.
    These human quirks mean we can never make
purely “rational” decisions. A new wave of behavioral
economists, aided by neuroscientists, is trying to
understand our psychology, both alone and in
groups, so they can anticipate our decisions in the
marketplace more accurately. But psychology can
also help us understand why we react in disgust at
economic injustice, or accept a moral law as
universal. Which means that the relatively new
science of human behavior might also define ethics
for us. Ethical economics would then emerge from
one of the least likely places: economists themselves.



Question 17:
Which choice best supports the author’s claim that there is common ground shared by the different approaches to ethics described in the passage?
A) Lines 11-12 (“There... decision”)
B) Lines 47-50 (“From... advertisements”)

This passage is adapted from Peter A. Ensminger, Life Under
the Sun. ©2001 by Peter A. Ensminger.

    Many millennia before the invention of
herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to
control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a
Line valuable part of an integrated weed-management
program. Although plowing kills standing weeds,
farmers have long known that it often leads to the
emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.
    Ecologists have shown that a farmer’s field can
have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter
buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists
have shown that seeds buried more than about one
centimeter below the soil surface do not receive
enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow,
which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil
surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the
surface where their germination is induced by
exposure to sunlight?
    Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn
Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a
relatively simple experiment, they went to ten
different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and
collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the
soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred
up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then
exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a
greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples,
weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in
light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives
weed seeds a “light break,” and this stimulates their
germination.
    More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen
University in Germany reasoned that when farmers
plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed
seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is
turned over, and that this stimulates their
germination. Although the light exposures from
plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can
be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the
germination of weed seeds would be minimized if
farmers simply plowed their fields during the night,
when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which
photons hit the surface] is below 10^15 photons per
square meter per second. Although even under these
conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike
each square millimeter of ground each second, this
illumination is below the threshold needed to
stimulate the germination of most seeds.
    Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when
he first came up with this idea because he assumed
that such a simple method of weed control as
plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would
have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent
experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific
meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated
that the method can be effective.
    Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two
agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated
threefold, at around midday and the other strip
at night. No crops were planted in these pilot
experiments, to avoid possible competition with
the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic.
More than 80 percent of the surface of the field
plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas
only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was
covered by weeds.
    This method of weed control is currently being
used by several farmers in Germany. Because many
of the same weed species that invade farmers’ fields
in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world,
this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact,
recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon,
Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina
support this idea.

Passage 1 is adapted from Talleyrand et al., Report on Public
Instruction. Originally published in 1791. Passage 2 is
adapted from Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. Originally published in 1792. Talleyrand
was a French diplomat; the Report was a plan for national
education. Wollstonecraft, a British novelist and political
writer, wrote Vindication in response to Talleyrand.

Passage 1
    That half the human race is excluded by the other
half from any participation in government; that they
are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land
where they were born; and that they are
property-owners yet have no direct influence or
representation: are all political phenomena
apparently impossible to explain on abstract
principle. But on another level of ideas, the question
changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose of
all these institutions must be the happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that leads us farther
from this purpose is in error; everything that brings
us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public
employments decreed against women leads to a
greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes,
then this becomes a law that all Societies have been
compelled to acknowledge and sanction.
    Any other ambition would be a reversal of our
primary destinies; and it will never be in women’s
interest to change the assignment they have received.
    It seems to us incontestable that our common
happiness, above all that of women, requires that
they never aspire to the exercise of political rights
and functions. Here we must seek their interests in
the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their
delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and
the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from
strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon
them to gentle occupations and the cares of the
home? And is it not evident that the great conserving
principle of Societies, which makes the division of
powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and
revealed by nature itself, when it divided the
functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a
manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke
principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us
not make rivals of life’s companions. You must, you
truly must allow the persistence of a union that no
interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand
that the good of all demands this of you.

Passage 2
    Contending for the rights of woman, my main
argument is built on this simple principle, that if she
be not prepared by education to become the
companion of man, she will stop the progress of
knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to
all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its
influence on general practice. And how can woman
be expected to co-operate unless she know why she
ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her
reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what
manner it is connected with her real good? If
children are to be educated to understand the true
principle of patriotism, their mother must be a
patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced
by considering the moral and civil interest of
mankind; but the education and situation of woman,
at present, shuts her out from such investigations....
    Consider, sir, dispassionately, these
observations—for a glimpse of this truth seemed to
open before you when you observed, “that to see one
half of the human race excluded by the other from all
participation of government, was a political
phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it
was impossible to explain.” If so, on what does your
constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will
bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by
a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same
test: though a different opinion prevails in this
country, built on the very arguments which you use
to justify the oppression of woman—prescription.
    Consider—I address you as a legislator—
whether, when men contend for their freedom, and
to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their
own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to
subjugate women, even though you firmly believe
that you are acting in the manner best calculated to
promote their happiness? Who made man the
exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift
of reason?
    In this style, argue tyrants of every
denomination, from the weak king to the weak
father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason;
yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be
useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force
all women, by denying them civil and political rights,
to remain immured in their families groping in
the dark?

This passage is adapted from Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle
S. Adams, ""Money Can't Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs about
Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation."" ©2008 by Elsevier
Inc.

    Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in
full force—both online and on foot—searching
frantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans
spent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of
December alone. Aside from purchasing holiday
gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other
occasions throughout the year, including weddings,
birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby
showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can
engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many
relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger
bonds with one’s closest peers. At the same time,
many dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry
that their purchases will disappoint rather than
delight the intended recipients.
    Anthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive
social process, serving various political, religious, and
psychological functions. Economists, however, offer
a less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),
gift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.
People buy gifts that recipients would not choose to
buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
money to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as
‘‘the deadweight loss of Christmas”). To wit, givers
are likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that
receivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.
This ‘‘deadweight loss” suggests that gift-givers are
not very good at predicting what gifts others will
appreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social
psychologists. Research has found that people often
struggle to take account of others’ perspectives—
their insights are subject to egocentrism, social
projection, and multiple attribution errors.
    What is surprising is that gift-givers have
considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and
gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend
each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.
In the present research, we propose a unique
psychological explanation for this overspending
problem—i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they
spend with how much recipients will appreciate the
gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a
gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation). Although a
link between gift price and feelings of appreciation
might seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an
assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose
that gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their
feelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift
than givers assume.
    Why do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely
linked to gift-recipients’ feelings of appreciation?
Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more
expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of
thoughtfulness and consideration. According to
Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a
symbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal
their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future
relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be
motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to
send a “stronger signal” to their intended recipient.
As for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller
and larger gifts as representing smaller and larger
signals of thoughtfulness and consideration.
    The notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being
unable to account for the other party’s perspective
seems puzzling because people slip in and out of
these roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple
times in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the
extensive experience that people have as both givers
and receivers, they often struggle to transfer
information gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)
and apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as
a receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize
information about their own preferences and
experiences in order to produce more efficient
outcomes in their exchange relations. In practical
terms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on
gifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift
expenditures according to personal insight.

Passage 1 is adapted from Brian Handwerk, “A New
Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria.”
©2015 by Smithsonian Institution. Passage 2 is adapted
from David Livermore, “This New Antibiotic Is Cause for
Celebration—and Caution.” ©2015 by Telegraph Media
Group Limited.

Passage 1
    “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Line Northeastern University.
    Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
    Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
    To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
    The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
    It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Passage 2
    Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-
producing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
    The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
    So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

This passage is adapted from Patricia Waldron, “Why Birds
Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

    Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
    There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
    The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
    Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”
    The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
    “From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
    Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
    “It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”

This passage is adapted from Saki, “The
Schartz-Metterklume Method.” Originally published in 1911.

    Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of
the small wayside station and took a turn or two up
and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the
train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,
in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling
with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort
that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal
that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a
different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her
acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful
admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on
behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being
“none of her business.” Only once had she put the
doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one
of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for
nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while
Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had
proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was
engaged on, and refused to interfere between the
boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this
occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to
the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout
the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore
the desertion with philosophical indifference; her
friends and relations were thoroughly well used to
the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by
another train.” Before she had time to think what her
next move might be she was confronted by an
imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a
prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.
    “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come
to meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted
of very little argument.
    “Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to
herself with dangerous meekness.
    “I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and
where, pray, is your luggage?”
    “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess,
falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent
are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude. “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer
approach to truth.
    “How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless. However, my
maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led
the way to her car.
    During the drive to the Quabarl mansion
Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the
nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her;
she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate,
sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was
something or other else of a mould equally
commonplace among children of that class and type
in the twentieth century.
    “I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,” said Mrs.
Quabarl, “but INTERESTED in what they learn. In
their history lessons, for instance, you must try to
make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not
merely committing a mass of names and dates to
memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk
at meal-times several days in the week.”
    “I shall talk French four days of the week and
Russian in the remaining three.”
    “Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the
house speaks or understands Russian.”
    “That will not embarrass me in the least,” said
Lady Carlotta coldly.
    Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was
knocked off her perch. She was one of those
imperfectly self-assured individuals who are
magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not
seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them
cowed and apologetic. When the new governess
failed to express wondering admiration of the large
newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly
alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the
discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject.
Her feelings were those which might have animated a
general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his
heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the
field by slingers and javelin throwers.

This passage is adapted from Daniel Chamovitz, What a
Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses. ©2012 by
Daniel Chamovitz

    The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
    We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
    Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of
calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
    They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
    Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.



Question 43:
Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap’s requirement for multiple triggers is that it
A) enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
B) conserves the plant’s calcium reserves.
C) safeguards the plant’s energy supply.
D) prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

This passage is adapted from Geoffrey Giller, “Long a
Mystery, How 500-Meter-High Undersea Waves Form Is
Revealed.” ©2014 by Scientific American.

    Some of the largest ocean waves in the world are
nearly impossible to see. Unlike other large waves,
these rollers, called internal waves, do not ride the
ocean surface. Instead, they move underwater,
undetectable without the use of satellite imagery or
sophisticated monitoring equipment. Despite their
hidden nature, internal waves are fundamental parts
of ocean water dynamics, transferring heat to the
ocean depths and bringing up cold water from below.
And they can reach staggering heights—some as tall
as skyscrapers.
    Because these waves are involved in ocean mixing
and thus the transfer of heat, understanding them is
crucial to global climate modeling, says Tom
Peacock, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Most models fail to take internal
waves into account. “If we want to have more and
more accurate climate models, we have to be able to
capture processes such as this,” Peacock says.
    Peacock and his colleagues tried to do just that.
Their study, published in November in Geophysical
Research Letters, focused on internal waves generated
in the Luzon Strait, which separates Taiwan and the
Philippines. Internal waves in this region, thought to
be some of the largest in the world, can reach about
500 meters high. “That’s the same height as the
Freedom Tower that’s just been built in New York,”
Peacock says.
    Although scientists knew of this phenomenon in
the South China Sea and beyond, they didn’t know
exactly how internal waves formed. To find out,
Peacock and a team of researchers from M.I.T. and
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution worked with
France’s National Center for Scientific Research
using a giant facility there called the Coriolis
Platform. The rotating platform, about 15 meters
(49.2 feet) in diameter, turns at variable speeds and
can simulate Earth’s rotation. It also has walls, which
means scientists can fill it with water and create
accurate, large-scale simulations of various
oceanographic scenarios.
    Peacock and his team built a carbon-fiber resin
scale model of the Luzon Strait, including the islands
and surrounding ocean floor topography. Then they
filled the platform with water of varying salinity to
replicate the different densities found at the strait,
with denser, saltier water below and lighter, less
briny water above. Small particles were added to the
solution and illuminated with lights from below in
order to track how the liquid moved. Finally, they
re-created tides using two large plungers to see how
the internal waves themselves formed.
    The Luzon Strait’s underwater topography, with a
distinct double-ridge shape, turns out to be
responsible for generating the underwater waves.
As the tide rises and falls and water moves through
the strait, colder, denser water is pushed up over the
ridges into warmer, less dense layers above it.
This action results in bumps of colder water trailed
by warmer water that generate an internal wave.
As these waves move toward land, they become
steeper—much the same way waves at the beach
become taller before they hit the shore—until they
break on a continental shelf.
    The researchers were also able to devise a
mathematical model that describes the movement
and formation of these waves. Whereas the model is
specific to the Luzon Strait, it can still help
researchers understand how internal waves are
generated in other places around the world.
Eventually, this information will be incorporated into
global climate models, making them more accurate.
“It’s very clear, within the context of these [global
climate] models, that internal waves play a role in
driving ocean circulations,” Peacock says.



Question 48:
Based on information in the passage, it can reasonably be inferred that all internal waves
A) reach approximately the same height even though the locations and depths of continental shelves vary.
B) may be caused by similar factors but are influenced by the distinct topographies of different regions.
C) can be traced to inconsistencies in the tidal patterns of deep ocean water located near islands.
D) are generated by the movement of dense water over a relatively flat section of the ocean floor.

Slavery and Abolitionism. Originally published in 1837.
Passage 2 is adapted from Angelina E. Grimké, Letters to
Catharine Beecher. Originally published in 1838. Grimké

Passage 1 is Beecher’s response to Grimké’s views.
Passage 2 is Grimké’s response to Beecher.

Passage 1
    Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior,
and to the other the subordinate station, and this
without any reference to the character or conduct of
either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is
for the interest of females, in all respects to conform
to the duties of this relation. . . . But while woman
holds a subordinate relation in society to the other
sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties
or her influence should be any the less important, or
all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of
gaining influence and of exercising power should be
altogether different and peculiar....
    A man may act on society by the collision of
intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures
by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest;
he may coerce by the combination of public
sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he
does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all
the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to
woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly,
generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.
    Woman is to win every thing by peace and love;
by making herself so much respected, esteemed and
loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her
wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But
this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and
social circle. There let every woman become so
cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and
judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling
and action; that her motives will be reverenced;—so
unassuming and unambitious, that collision and
competition will be banished;—so “gentle and easy to
be entreated,” as that every heart will repose in her
presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the
sons, will find an influence thrown around them,
to which they will yield not only willingly but
proudly....
    A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and
combination among her own sex, to assist her in her
appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and
domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws
a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for
herself or others—whatever binds her in a party
conflict—whatever obliges her in any way to exert
coercive influences, throws her out of her
appropriate sphere. If these general principles are
correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of
arraying females in any Abolition movement.

Passage 2
    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.



Question 16:
What is Grimké’s central claim in Passage 2?
A) The rights of individuals are not determined by race or gender.
B) Men and women must learn to work together to improve society.
C) Moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals.
D) Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish.

This passage is adapted from “How the Web Affects
Memory.” ©2011 by Harvard Magazine Inc.


    Search engines have changed the way we use the
Internet, putting vast sources of information just a
few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology
Line Daniel Wegner’s recent research proves that
websites—and the Internet—are changing much
more than technology itself. They are changing the
way our memories function.
    Wegner’s latest study, “Google Effects on
Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having
Information at Our Fingertips,” shows that when
people have access to search engines, they remember
fewer facts and less information because they know
they can rely on “search” as a readily available
shortcut.
    Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes
the new findings show that the Internet has become
part of a transactive memory source, a method by
which our brains compartmentalize information.
First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive
memory exists in many forms, as when a husband
relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.
“[It is] this whole network of memory where you
don’t have to remember everything in the world
yourself,” he says. “You just have to remember who
knows it.” Now computers and technology as well
are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.
    The idea validates habits already forming in our
daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary
location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars
remove the need to memorize directions.
Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our
memories too far to remember the name of an
obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan—we
just type our questions into Google. “We become
part of the Internet in a way,” he says. “We become
part of the system and we end up trusting it.”
    Working with researchers Betsy Sparrow of
Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University
of Wisconsin–Madison, Wegner conducted four
experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using
various forms of memory recall to test reliance on
computers. In the first experiment, participants
demonstrated that they were more likely to think of
computer terms like “Yahoo” or “Google” after being
asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other
experiments, participants were asked to type a
collection of readily memorable statements, such as
“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” Half the
subjects were told that their work would be saved to a
computer; the other half were informed that the
statements would be erased. In subsequent memory
testing, participants who were told their work would
not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In
a fourth experiment, participants typed into a
computer statements they were told would be saved
in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the
statements. Finally, they were given cues to the
wording and asked to name the folders where the
statements were stored. The participants proved
better able to recall the folder locations than the
statements themselves.
    Wegner concedes that questions remain about
whether dependence on computers will affect
memories negatively: “Nobody knows now what the
effects are of these tools on logical thinking.”
Students who have trouble remembering distinct
facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts
in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation
overall is beneficial, likening dependence on
computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or
other prosthetic device.
    And even though we may not be taxing our
memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using
them to consider where the facts are located and how
to access them. “We still have to remember things,”
Wegner explains. “We’re just remembering a
different range of things.” He believes his study will
lead to further research into understanding computer
dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent
of human interdependence with the computer
world—pinpointing the “movable dividing line
between us and our computers in cyber networks.”



Question 11:
The main purpose of the passage is to
A) describe a series of experiments on the way technology interferes with critical thinking.
B) assert that people have become overly dependent on computers for storing information.
C) discuss the idea that humans’ capacity for memory is much weaker than it once was.

This passage is adapted from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s
address to the 1869 Woman Suffrage Convention in
Washington, DC.

    I urge a sixteenth amendment, because “manhood
suffrage,” or a man’s government, is civil, religious,
and social disorganization. The male element is a
destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving
war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the
material and moral world alike discord, disorder,
disease, and death. See what a record of blood and
cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what
slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what
inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and
persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the
soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries,
while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have
been dead alike to love and hope!
    The male element has held high carnival thus far;
it has fairly run riot from the beginning,
overpowering the feminine element everywhere,
crushing out all the diviner qualities in human
nature, until we know but little of true manhood and
womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for
it has scarce been recognized as a power until within
the last century. Society is but the reflection of man
himself, untempered by woman’s thought; the hard
iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the
home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at
the fragmentary condition of everything, when we
remember that man, who represents but half a
complete being, with but half an idea on every
subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all
sublunary matters.
    People object to the demands of those whom they
choose to call the strong-minded, because they say
“the right of suffrage will make the women
masculine.” That is just the difficulty in which we are
involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few
women in the best sense; we have simply so many
reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine
gender. The strong, natural characteristics of
womanhood are repressed and ignored in
dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she
will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his
condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman
must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas,
opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She
must respect his statutes, though they strip her of
every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher
law written by the finger of God on her own soul....
    . . . [M]an has been molding woman to his ideas
by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a
negation, has used indirect means to control him,
and in most cases developed the very characteristics
both in him and herself that needed repression.
And now man himself stands appalled at the results
of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that
falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life.
The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines,
railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of
womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true
religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of
thought and action.
    We ask woman’s enfranchisement, as the first step
toward the recognition of that essential element in
government that can only secure the health, strength,
and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift
woman to her true position will help to usher in a
new day of peace and perfection for the race.
    In speaking of the masculine element, I do not
wish to be understood to say that all men are hard,
selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful
spirits the world has known have been clothed with
manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though
often marked in woman, that distinguish what is
called the stronger sex. For example, the love of
acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of
civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the
elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers
of destruction when used to subjugate one man to
another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.
    Here that great conservator of woman’s love, if
permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in
freedom against oppression, violence, and war,
would hold all these destructive forces in check, for
woman knows the cost of life better than man does,
and not with her consent would one drop of blood
ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.
