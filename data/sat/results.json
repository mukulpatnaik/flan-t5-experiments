making trial of everything, with\ntrust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in\nall eyes that looked on her The gold had kept his\nthoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to\nnothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object\ncompacted of changes and hopes that forced his\nthoughts onward, and carried them far away from\ntheir old eager pacing towards the same blank\nlimit\u2014carried them away to the new things that\nwould come with the coming years, when Eppie\nwould have learned to understand how her father\nSilas cared for her; and made him look for images of\nthat time in the ties and charities that bound together\nthe families of his neighbors The gold had asked that\nhe should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened\nand blinded more and more to all things except the\nmonotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;\nbut Eppie called him away from his weaving, and\nmade him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening\nhis senses with her fresh life, even to the old\nwinter-flies that came crawling forth in the early\nspring sunshine, and warming him into joy because\nshe had joy\n    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,\nso that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,\nSilas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the\nlate afternoon when the shadows were lengthening\nunder the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered\nhead to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where\nthe flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank\nwhere he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to\npluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged\nthings that murmured happily above the bright\npetals, calling \u201cDad-dad\u2019s\u201d attention continually by\nbringing him the flowers Then she would turn her\near to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to\nplease her by making signs of hushed stillness, that\nthey might listen for the note to come again: so that\nwhen it came, she set up her small back and laughed\nwith gurgling triumph Sitting on the banks in this\nway, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs\nagain;

Then, beginning in 2000, the\nlines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,\nbut employment suddenly wilts.

Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that\ntechnology boosts productivity and makes societies\nwealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark\nside: technological progress is eliminating the need\nfor many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker\nworse off than before.
