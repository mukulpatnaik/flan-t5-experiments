       "'SAT READING COMPREHENSION TEST\\n\\nThis passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.\\nOriginally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a\\nnotorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was\\nstolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the\\ndaughter of an impoverished woman who had died\\nsuddenly.\\n\\n    Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must\\nbe worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was\\nhidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song\\nof birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a\\ncreature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,\\nseeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and\\nliving movements; making trial of everything, with\\ntrust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in\\nall eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his\\nthoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to\\nnothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object\\ncompacted of changes and hopes that forced his\\nthoughts onward, and carried them far away from\\ntheir old eager pacing towards the same blank\\nlimit—carried them away to the new things that\\nwould come with the coming years, when Eppie\\nwould have learned to understand how her father\\nSilas cared for her; and made him look for images of\\nthat time in the ties and charities that bound together\\nthe families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that\\nhe should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened\\nand blinded more and more to all things except the\\nmonotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;\\nbut Eppie called him away from his weaving, and\\nmade him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening\\nhis senses with her fresh life, even to the old\\nwinter-flies that came crawling forth in the early\\nspring sunshine, and warming him into joy because\\nshe had joy.\\n    And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,\\nso that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,\\nSilas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the\\nlate afternoon when the shadows were lengthening\\nunder the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered\\nhead to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where\\nthe flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank\\nwhere he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to\\npluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged\\nthings that murmured happily above the bright\\npetals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by\\nbringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her\\near to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to\\nplease her by making signs of hushed stillness, that\\nthey might listen for the note to come again: so that\\nwhen it came, she set up her small back and laughed\\nwith gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this\\nway, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs\\nagain; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline\\nand markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of\\ncrowding remembrances from which he turned away\\ntimidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay\\nlightly on his enfeebled spirit.\\n    As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,\\nhis mind was growing into memory: as her life\\nunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow\\nprison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually\\ninto full consciousness.\\n    It was an influence which must gather force with\\nevery new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart\\ngrew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;\\nshapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and\\nears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was\\nimperatively required to notice and account for.\\nAlso, by the time Eppie was three years old, she\\ndeveloped a fine capacity for mischief, and for\\ndevising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which\\nfound much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but\\nfor his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor\\nSilas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible\\ndemands of love.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 3:\\nWhich statement best describes a technique the narrator uses to represent Silas’s character before he adopted Eppie?\\nA) The narrator emphasizes Silas’s former obsession with wealth by depicting his gold as requiring certain behaviors on his part.\\nB) The narrator underscores Silas’s former greed by describing his gold as seeming to reproduce on its own.\\nC) The narrator hints at Silas’s former antisocial attitude by contrasting his present behavior toward his neighbors with his past behavior toward them.\\nD) The narrator demonstrates Silas’s former lack of self-awareness by implying that he is unable to recall life before Eppie.\\n\\nAnswer:'"

       "'Heather Jack and her family, including her two children, usually spend the Christmas holidays preparing a feast--for others to eat. Last Christmas Eve, they went to a house in the neighborhood and prepared a dinner for an elderly woman and her son, who has muscular dystrophy . They stayed for an hour and chatted before heading home to prepare for a visit from Santa  .  \"I think it is that kind of direct experience that many find so meaningful,\" says Heather, president and founder of The Volunteer Family, a Boston-based organization dedicated to matching families with volunteer opportunities, both during the holidays and year-round. \"It\\'s a great way for parents to involve the kids.\" In a holiday season that stretches from before Thanksgiving to just after the New Year, it\\'s nice to hear stories about people with their children giving instead of receiving. Last December Gary and Debra Danoff and their two teenage sons drove to the Washington, D. C. Jewish Community Center(JCC) and spent Christmas morning in the Center\\'s kitchen preparing a feast for homeless shelters.  By choosing to prepare meals for the homeless, the Danoffs bring together a belief in community service with their love of cooking, \"It feels good to prepare food with our kids for other people at Christmas,\" says Gary. \"We want them to know that many people don\\'t have the ability to go to the supermarket and pick the foods they want to eat and pay for them.\" The Danoffs were in good company. Across the city, at least 1000 volunteers with their children went across the region to provide food to the poor people as part of the D. C. JCC\\'s annual \"December 25th Day of Service\", now in its 22nd year. The Heathers did all the following things except_last Christmas Eve.'"

       "'There are some very good inventions which, for one reason or another, don\\'t become popular. These inventions should be better known, even though I think that some of them are crazy. Let\\'s have a look at some of these inventions and see if you agree that they should be more successful. The Australians had a great idea to stop people from drinking and driving. The idea was that if a driver wanted to start the car, she or he would have to blow into a bag first. If there was too much alcohol   in their breath, the car wouldn\\'t start. It sounded like a great idea to me, but people said that they might need to drive the car in an emergency   even if they had drunk too much alcohol. Another idea I liked was an invention by a scientist who thought his children watched too much TV. He connected the TV to an exercise bike so that the electricity to power the TV was produced by the bike. If the children wanted to watch a lot of TV, they had to pedal   very hard. I found another invention on the Internet which encouraged good habits. Believe it or not, this invention was an ashtray   which spoke to you when you lit a cigarette! The \"voice\" of the ashtray was started by the heat from the cigarette and reminded you how dangerous it is to smoke. One of the strangest inventions I have come across is a bicycle which can cross rivers! The idea was that when you came to a river, you could _ a huge plastic ball all around the bike. You would then get into the ball which would float on the river while you pedaled the bike inside the ball! Why not use a bridge instead? A friend of mine at school once bought a strange pair of football shoes. On the bottom of the shoes there was a rotating pad of studs  . The idea was that you would change direction more quickly if the studs rotated with you. The problem was that every time you stopped you changed direction whether you wanted to or not! I think he wore those shoes twice! One thing I would like is a baseball cap with a built-in radio so you can listen to sport all day with your hands free. While we are on the subject of sport, the Americans invented a kind of robot for sports fans. If you were watching your team on TV on your own, you could press a button and the robot would do \"high fives\" with you! Fantastic! I wonder if you have any good ideas for inventions like these. What can we know from the passage?'"
