       "'Heather Jack and her family, including her two children, usually spend the Christmas holidays preparing a feast--for others to eat. Last Christmas Eve, they went to a house in the neighborhood and prepared a dinner for an elderly woman and her son, who has muscular dystrophy . They stayed for an hour and chatted before heading home to prepare for a visit from Santa  .  \"I think it is that kind of direct experience that many find so meaningful,\" says Heather, president and founder of The Volunteer Family, a Boston-based organization dedicated to matching families with volunteer opportunities, both during the holidays and year-round. \"It\\'s a great way for parents to involve the kids.\" In a holiday season that stretches from before Thanksgiving to just after the New Year, it\\'s nice to hear stories about people with their children giving instead of receiving. Last December Gary and Debra Danoff and their two teenage sons drove to the Washington, D. C. Jewish Community Center(JCC) and spent Christmas morning in the Center\\'s kitchen preparing a feast for homeless shelters.  By choosing to prepare meals for the homeless, the Danoffs bring together a belief in community service with their love of cooking, \"It feels good to prepare food with our kids for other people at Christmas,\" says Gary. \"We want them to know that many people don\\'t have the ability to go to the supermarket and pick the foods they want to eat and pay for them.\" The Danoffs were in good company. Across the city, at least 1000 volunteers with their children went across the region to provide food to the poor people as part of the D. C. JCC\\'s annual \"December 25th Day of Service\", now in its 22nd year. The Heathers did all the following things except_last Christmas Eve.'"

       "'There are some very good inventions which, for one reason or another, don\\'t become popular. These inventions should be better known, even though I think that some of them are crazy. Let\\'s have a look at some of these inventions and see if you agree that they should be more successful. The Australians had a great idea to stop people from drinking and driving. The idea was that if a driver wanted to start the car, she or he would have to blow into a bag first. If there was too much alcohol   in their breath, the car wouldn\\'t start. It sounded like a great idea to me, but people said that they might need to drive the car in an emergency   even if they had drunk too much alcohol. Another idea I liked was an invention by a scientist who thought his children watched too much TV. He connected the TV to an exercise bike so that the electricity to power the TV was produced by the bike. If the children wanted to watch a lot of TV, they had to pedal   very hard. I found another invention on the Internet which encouraged good habits. Believe it or not, this invention was an ashtray   which spoke to you when you lit a cigarette! The \"voice\" of the ashtray was started by the heat from the cigarette and reminded you how dangerous it is to smoke. One of the strangest inventions I have come across is a bicycle which can cross rivers! The idea was that when you came to a river, you could _ a huge plastic ball all around the bike. You would then get into the ball which would float on the river while you pedaled the bike inside the ball! Why not use a bridge instead? A friend of mine at school once bought a strange pair of football shoes. On the bottom of the shoes there was a rotating pad of studs  . The idea was that you would change direction more quickly if the studs rotated with you. The problem was that every time you stopped you changed direction whether you wanted to or not! I think he wore those shoes twice! One thing I would like is a baseball cap with a built-in radio so you can listen to sport all day with your hands free. While we are on the subject of sport, the Americans invented a kind of robot for sports fans. If you were watching your team on TV on your own, you could press a button and the robot would do \"high fives\" with you! Fantastic! I wonder if you have any good ideas for inventions like these. What can we know from the passage?'"
